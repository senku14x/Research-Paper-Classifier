Recordings
Abstract
This research introduces MLB-YouTube, a new and complex dataset created for
nuanced activity recognition in baseball videos. This dataset is structured to
support two types of analysis: one for classifying activities in segmented videos
and another for detecting activities in unsegmented, continuous video streams. This
study evaluates several methods for recognizing activities, focusing on how they
capture the temporal organization of activities in videos. This evaluation starts
with categorizing segmented videos and progresses to applying these methods
to continuous video feeds. Additionally, this paper assesses the effectiveness of
different models in the challenging task of forecasting pitch velocity and type
using baseball broadcast videos. The findings indicate that incorporating temporal
dynamics into models is beneficial for detailed activity recognition.

Introduction
Action recognition, a significant problem in computer vision, finds extensive use in sports. Profes-
sional sporting events are extensively recorded for entertainment, and these recordings are invaluable
for subsequent analysis by coaches, scouts, and media analysts. While numerous game statistics
are currently gathered manually, the potential exists for these to be replaced by computer vision
systems. Systems like PITCHf/x and Statcast have been employed by Major League Baseball (MLB)
to automatically record pitch speed and movement, utilizing a network of high-speed cameras and
radar to collect detailed data on each player. Access to much of this data is restricted from the public
domain.
This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel dataset that includes densely annotated frames of activi-
ties extracted from broadcast baseball videos. Unlike many current datasets for activity recognition or
detection, our dataset emphasizes fine-grained activity recognition. The differences between activities
are often minimal, primarily involving the movement of a single individual, with a consistent scene
structure across activities. The determination of activity is based on a single camera perspective. This
study compares various methods for temporal feature aggregation, both for classifying activities in
segmented videos and for detecting them in continuous video streams.

Related Work
The field of activity recognition has garnered substantial attention in computer vision research. Initial
successes were achieved with hand-engineered features such as dense trajectories. The focus of more
recent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
activity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and optical
flow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have been
developed. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasets
such as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet.
Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activity
recognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short-
.
Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and max-pooling across entire videos yielded the best outcomes. It
has been discovered that pooling intervals from varying locations and durations is advantageous for
activity recognition. It was demonstrated that identifying and classifying key sub-event intervals can
lead to better performance.
Recently, segment-based 3D CNNs have been employed to capture spatio-temporal data concurrently
for activity detection. These methods depend on the 3D CNN to capture temporal dynamics, which
typically span only 16 frames. Although longer-term temporal structures have been explored, this was
usually accomplished with temporal pooling of localized features or (spatio-)temporal convolutions
with extended fixed intervals. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been applied to represent
transitions in activity between frames.

MLB-YouTube Dataset
We have compiled an extensive dataset from 20 baseball games of the 2017 MLB postseason, available
on YouTube, totaling over 42 hours of video. Our dataset includes two main parts: segmented videos
intended for activity recognition and continuous videos designed for activity classification. The
dataset’s complexity is amplified by the fact that it originates from televised baseball games, where a
single camera perspective is shared among various activities. Additionally, there is minimal variance
in motion and appearance among different activities, such as swinging a bat versus bunting. In
contrast to datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet, which encompass a broad spectrum of activities
with diverse settings, scales, and camera angles, our dataset features activities where a single frame
might not be adequate to determine the activity.
The minor differences between a ball and a strike are illustrated in Figure 3. Differentiating between
these actions requires identifying whether the batter swings or not, detecting the umpire’s signal
(Figure 4) for a strike, or noting the absence of a signal for a ball. This is further complicated because
the batter or catcher can obstruct the umpire, and each umpire has their unique style of signaling a
strike.
Our dataset for segmented video analysis comprises 4,290 clips. Each clip is annotated for multiple
baseball actions, including swing, hit, ball, strike, and foul. Given that a single clip may contain
several activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the complete
list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch
were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a
collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances
include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of
activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.
Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every
frame in these videos is annotated with the baseball activities that occur. On average, each continuous
clip contains 7.2 activities, amounting to over 15,000 activity instances in total.

Segmented Video Recognition Approach
We investigate different techniques for aggregating temporal features in segmented video activity
recognition. In segmented videos, the classification task is simpler because each frame corresponds to
an activity, eliminating the need for the model to identify the start and end of activities. Our methods
are based on a CNN that generates a per-frame or per-segment representation, derived from standard
two-stream CNNs using deep CNNs like I3D or InceptionV3.
Given video features v of dimensions T × D, where T represents the video’s temporal length and D
is the feature’s dimensionality, the usual approach for feature pooling involves max- or mean-pooling
across the temporal dimension, followed by a fully-connected layer for video clip classification, as
depicted in Fig. 5(a). This approach, however, yields a single representation for the entire video,
losing temporal information. An alternative is to employ a fixed temporal pyramid with various
lengths, as shown in Fig 5(b), dividing the video into intervals of lengths 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, and
max-pooling each. The pooled features are concatenated, creating a K × D representation, where K
is the number of intervals in the temporal pyramid, and a fully-connected layer classifies the clip.
We also explore learning temporal convolution filters to aggregate local temporal structures. A kernel
of size L×1 is applied to each frame, enabling each timestep representation to incorporate information
from adjacent frames. After applying max-pooling to the output of the temporal convolution, a fully-
connected layer is used for classification, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c).
While temporal pyramid pooling retains some structure, the intervals are fixed and predetermined.
Previous studies have shown that learning the sub-interval to pool is beneficial for activity recognition.
These learned intervals are defined by three parameters: a center g, a width σ, and a stride δ,
parameterizing N Gaussians. Given the video length T, the positions of the strided Gaussians are
first calculated as:
gn = 0.5 −T −(gn + 1)
N −1
forn = 0, 1, . . . , N −1
pt,n = gn + (t −0.5T + 0.5)1
δ
fort = 0, 1, . . . , T −1
The filters are then generated as:
Fm[i, t] =
1
Zm
exp

−(t −µi,m)2
2σ2m

i ∈{0, 1, . . . , N −1}, t ∈{0, 1, . . . , T −1}
where Zm is a normalization constant.
We apply these filters F to the T × D video representation through matrix multiplication, yielding an
N × D representation that serves as input to a fully-connected layer for classification. This method
is shown in Fig 5(d).
Additionally, we compare a bi-directional LSTM with 512 hidden units, using the final hidden state
as input to a fully-connected layer for classification. We frame our tasks as multi-label classification
and train these models to minimize binary cross-entropy:
L(v) =
X
c
zc log(p(c|G(v))) + (1 −zc) log(1 −p(c|G(v)))
where G(v) is the function that pools the temporal information, and zc is the ground truth label for
class c.
5
Activity Detection in Continuous Videos
Detecting activities in continuous videos poses a greater challenge. The goal here is to classify each
frame according to the activities occurring. Unlike segmented videos, continuous videos feature
multiple sequential activities, often interspersed with frames of inactivity. This necessitates that
the model learn to identify the start and end points of activities. As a baseline, we train a single
fully-connected layer to serve as a per-frame classifier, which does not utilize temporal information
beyond that contained in the features.
3
We adapt the methods developed for segmented video classification to continuous videos by imple-
menting a temporal sliding window approach. We select a fixed window duration of L features, apply
max-pooling to each window (similar to Fig. 5(a)), and classify each pooled segment. This approach
is extended to temporal pyramid pooling by dividing the window of length L into segments of lengths
L/2, L/4, and L/8, resulting in 14 segments per window. Max-pooling is applied to each segment,
and the pooled features are concatenated, yielding a 14 × D-dimensional representation for each
window, which is then used as input to the classifier.
For temporal convolutional models in continuous videos, we modify the segmented video approach by
learning a temporal convolutional kernel of length L and convolving it with the input video features.
This operation transforms input of size T × D into output of size T × D, followed by a per-frame
classifier. This enables the model to aggregate local temporal information.
To extend the sub-event model to continuous videos, we follow a similar approach but set T = L in
Eq. 1, resulting in filters of length L. The T ×D video representation is convolved with the sub-event
filters F, producing an N × D × T-dimensional representation used as input to a fully-connected
layer for frame classification.
The model is trained to minimize per-frame binary classification:
L(v) =
X
t,c
zt,c log(p(c|H(vt))) + (1 −zt,c) log(1 −p(c|H(vt)))
where vt is the per-frame or per-segment feature at time t, H(vt) is the sliding window application of
one of the feature pooling methods, and zt,c is the ground truth class at time t.
A method to learn ’super-events’ (i.e., global video context) has been introduced and shown to be
effective for activity detection in continuous videos. This approach involves learning a set of temporal
structure filters modeled as N Cauchy distributions. Each distribution is defined by a center xn and a
width γn. Given the video length T, the filters are constructed by:
xn = (T −1)(tanh(x′
n) + 1)
2
fn(t) = 1
Zn
γn
π((t −xn)2 + γ2n) exp(1 −2| tanh(γ′
n)|)
where Zn is a normalization constant, t ∈{1, 2, . . . , T}, and n ∈{1, 2, . . . , N}.
The filters are combined with learned per-class soft-attention weights A, and the super-event repre-
sentation is computed as:
Sc =
X
n
Ac,n
X
t
fn(t) · vt
where v is the T × D video representation. These filters enable the model to focus on relevant
intervals for temporal context. The super-event representation is concatenated to each timestep and
used for classification. We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
was computed and clipped to [−20, 20]. For InceptionV3, features were computed every 3 frames
(8 fps), while for I3D, every frame was used, with I3D having a temporal stride of 8, resulting in
3 features per second (3 fps). Models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using the Adam
optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, for a total of 50
epochs.

Segmented Video Activity Recognition
We initially conducted binary pitch/non-pitch classification for each video segment. This task is
relatively straightforward due to the distinct differences between pitch and non-pitch frames. The
results, detailed in Table 2, reveal minimal variation across different features or models.

Multi-label Classification
We assessed various temporal feature aggregation methods by calculating the mean average precision
(mAP) for each video clip, a standard metric for multi-label classification. Table 4 compares the
performance of these methods. All methods surpass mean/max-pooling, highlighting the importance
of preserving temporal structure for activity recognition. Fixed temporal pyramid pooling and LSTMs
show some improvement. Temporal convolution offers a more significant performance boost but
requires substantially more parameters (see Table 3). Learning sub-events, as per previous research,
yields the best results. While LSTMs and temporal convolutions have been used before, they need
more parameters and perform less effectively, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, LSTMs necessitate
sequential processing of video features, whereas other methods can be fully parallelized.

Table 5 shows the average precision for each activity class. Learning temporal structure is particularly
beneficial for frame-based features (e.g., InceptionV3), which capture less temporal information

compared to segment-based features (e.g., I3D). Sub-event learning significantly aids in detecting
strikes, hits, foul balls, and hit-by-pitch events, which exhibit changes in video features post-event.
For instance, after a hit, the camera often tracks the ball’s trajectory, while after a hit-by-pitch, it
follows the player to first base, as illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.

Pitch Speed Regression
Estimating pitch speed from video frames is an exceptionally difficult problem, as it requires the
network to pinpoint the pitch’s start and end, and derive the speed from a minimal signal. The baseball,
often obscured by the pitcher, travels at speeds over 100mph and covers 60.5 feet in approximately 0.5
seconds. Initially, with frame rates of 8fps and 3fps, only 1-2 features captured the pitch in mid-air,
proving insufficient for speed determination. Utilizing the 60fps rate available in YouTube videos, we
recalculated optical flow and extracted RGB frames at this higher rate. Employing a fully-connected
layer with a single output for pitch speed prediction and minimizing the L1 loss between predicted
and actual speeds, we achieved an average error of 3.6mph. Table 6 compares different models, and
Fig. 8 illustrates the sub-events learned for various speeds.

Pitch Type Classification
We conducted experiments to determine the feasibility of predicting pitch types from video, a task
made challenging by pitchers’ efforts to disguise their pitches from batters and the subtle differences
between pitches, such as grip and rotation. We incorporated pose data extracted using OpenPose,
utilizing heatmaps of joint and body part locations as input to a newly trained InceptionV3 CNN.
Pose features were considered due to variations in body mechanics between different pitches. Our
dataset includes six pitch types, with results presented in Table 7. LSTMs performed worse than the
baseline, likely due to overfitting, whereas learning sub-events proved beneficial. Fastballs were the
easiest to detect (68% accuracy), followed by sliders (45%), while sinkers were the most difficult
(12%).
6.3
Continuous Video Activity Detection
We evaluate models extended for continuous videos using per-frame mean average precision (mAP),
with results shown in Table 8. This setting is more challenging than segmented videos, requiring
the model to identify activity start and end times and handle ambiguous negative examples. All
models improve upon the baseline per-frame classification, confirming the importance of temporal
information. Fixed temporal pyramid pooling outperforms max-pooling, while LSTM and temporal

recognition in videos. We conduct a comparative analysis of various recognition techniques that
employ temporal feature pooling for both segmented and continuous videos. Our findings reveal that
learning sub-events to pinpoint temporal regions of interest significantly enhances performance in
segmented video classification. In the context of activity detection in continuous videos, we establish

R007.pdf,"Advancements in 3D Food Modeling: A Review of the
MetaFood Challenge Techniques and Outcomes
Abstract
The growing focus on leveraging computer vision for dietary oversight and nutri-
tion tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methods
for food. The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited
collaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly
hindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by
introducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically
accurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-
ibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels
of complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A
total of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies
developed during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in
3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in
dietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop
challenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL.

Introduction
The convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative
approaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge
represents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise
and scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such
technologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to
diet.
By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual
inputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the
disparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique
solutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also
meeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer
vision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.
These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food
portion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional
investigations.
Conventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires
(FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be
burdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression-
based methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing
3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment
tools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly
impact nutrition science and public health.
Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim-
icking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary
.
recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based
on the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single
top-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of
proposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use
of a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,
ensuring the 3D models maintained accurate real-world measurements for portion size estimation.
This initiative not only expands the frontiers of 3D reconstruction technology but also sets the stage
for more reliable and user-friendly real-world applications, including image-based dietary assessment.
The resulting solutions hold the potential to profoundly influence nutritional intake monitoring and
comprehension, supporting broader health and wellness objectives. As progress continues, innovative
applications are anticipated to transform personal health management, nutritional research, and the
wider food industry. The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the
existing literature on food portion size estimation, Section 3 describes the dataset and evaluation
framework used in the challenge, and Sections 4, 5, and 6 discuss the methodologies and findings of
the top three teams (VolETA, ININ-VIAUN, and FoodRiddle), respectively.

Related Work
Estimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, aiming to determine the
volume, energy content, or macronutrients directly from images of meals. Unlike the well-studied
task of food recognition, estimating food portions is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D
information and physical size references necessary for accurately judging the actual size of food
portions. Accurate portion size estimation requires understanding the volume and density of food,
elements that are hard to deduce from a 2D image, underscoring the need for sophisticated techniques
to tackle this problem. Current methods for estimating food portions are grouped into four categories.
Stereo-Based Approaches use multiple images to reconstruct the 3D structure of food. Some methods
estimate food volume using multi-view stereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while
others perform two-view dense reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has
also been used for continuous, real-time food volume estimation. However, these methods are limited
by their need for multiple images, which is not always practical.
Model-Based Approaches use predefined shapes and templates to estimate volume. For instance,
certain templates are assigned to foods from a library and transformed based on physical references to
estimate the size and location of the food. Template matching approaches estimate food volume from
a single image, but they struggle with variations in food shapes that differ from predefined templates.
Recent work has used 3D food meshes as templates to align camera and object poses for portion size
estimation.
Depth Camera-Based Approaches use depth cameras to create depth maps, capturing the distance from
the camera to the food. These depth maps form a voxel representation used for volume estimation.
The main drawback is the need for high-quality depth maps and the extra processing required for
consumer-grade depth sensors.
Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
""Energy Distribution Map"" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
approaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,
and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D
reconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting
to various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,
and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the
organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and
2
develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques,
impacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.

Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline
3.1
Dataset Description
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.

Evaluation Pipeline
The evaluation process is split into two phases, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D
models in terms of shape (3D structure) and portion size (volume).
3.2.1
Phase-I: Volume Accuracy
In the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate portion size
accuracy, calculated as follows:
MAPE = 1
n
n
X
i=1

Ai −Fi
Ai
 × 100%

where Ai is the actual volume (in ml) of the i-th food item obtained from the scanned 3D food mesh,
and Fi is the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.
3.2.2
Phase-II: Shape Accuracy
Teams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to submit complete 3D mesh files for each food item.
This phase involves several steps to ensure precision and fairness:
• Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final Phase-I submissions for
consistency, and visual inspections are conducted to prevent rule violations.
• Model Alignment: Participants receive ground truth 3D models and a script to compute the
final Chamfer distance. They must align their models with the ground truth and prepare a
transformation matrix for each submitted object. The final Chamfer distance is calculated
using these models and matrices.
• Chamfer Distance Calculation: Shape accuracy is assessed using the Chamfer distance
metric. Given two point sets X and Y , the Chamfer distance is defined as:
dCD(X, Y ) =
1
|X|
X
x∈X
min
y∈Y ∥x −y∥2
2 + 1
|Y |
X
y∈Y
min
x∈X ∥x −y∥2
2
(2)
This metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models and
the ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volume
accuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues were
found with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excluded
from the final overall evaluation.

First Place Team - VolETA
4.1
Methodology
The team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate
precise food volumes.
4.1.1
Overview
The team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume
from RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual
hashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural
surface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including
isolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides a
thorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis.
4.1.2
The Team’s Proposal: VolETA
The team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food object
masks. The RGBD images, denoted as ID = {IDi}n
i=1, where n is the total number of frames,
provide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, {M f
i }n
i=1, help identify
regions of interest within these images.
Next, the team selects keyframes. From the set {IDi}n
i=1, keyframes {IK
j }k
j=1 ⊆{IDi}n
i=1 are
chosen. A method is implemented to detect and remove duplicate and blurry images, ensuring
high-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier
transform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold-
ing to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excluded
to maintain data integrity and accuracy.
Using the selected keyframes {IK
j }k
j=1, the team estimates camera poses through a method called
PixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, and
refining them. The outputs are the camera poses {Cj}k
j=1, crucial for understanding the scene’s
spatial layout.
4
In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments
the reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask M R for each
keyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method
extends the reference object mask M R to all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object
masks {M R
i }n
i=1. This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.
To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {M R
i }n
i=1, and
food object masks {M F
i }n
i=1. This step, denoted as {IR
i }n
i=1, integrates various data sources into a
unified format for further processing.
The team converts the RGBA images {IR
i }n
i=1 and camera poses {Cj}k
j=1 into meaningful metadata
and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.
The modeled data Dm is input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes
{Rf, Rr} for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the
""Remove Isolated Pieces"" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food
item, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected
components with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This
step ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained.
The team manually identifies an initial scaling factor S using the reference mesh via MeshLab. This
factor is fine-tuned to Sf using depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate
scaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor Sf is applied to the
cleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RF f. This step culminates in an
accurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation.
4.1.3
Detecting the scaling factor
Generally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the team
manually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the reference
object mesh. The average of all block lengths lavg is calculated, while the actual real-world length is
constant at lreal = 0.012 meters. The scaling factor S = lreal/lavg is applied to the clean food mesh
RCf, resulting in the final scaled food mesh RF f in meters.
The team uses depth information along with food and reference object masks to validate the scaling
factors. The method for assessing food size involves using overhead RGB images for each scene.
Initially, the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) is determined using the reference object. Subse-
quently, the food width (fw) and length (fl) are extracted using a food object mask. To determine the
food height (fh), a two-step process is followed. First, binary image segmentation is performed using
the overhead depth and reference images, yielding a segmented depth image for the reference object.
The average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth (dr). Similarly,
employing binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the
average depth for the segmented food depth image (df) is computed. The estimated food height fh is
the absolute difference between dr and df. To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the food
bounding box volume (fw × fl × fh) × PPU is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factor
S generates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. Table 2 lists the scaling
factors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume.
For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a single
RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images.
Isolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor S, which is closer to the
potential volume of the clean mesh, is reused.
4.2
Experimental Results
4.2.1
Implementation settings
Experiments were conducted using two GPUs: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/12G and RTX 3060/6G. The
Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
""aabb scale"" of 1, ""scale"" of 0.15, and ""offset"" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.

4.2.2
VolETA Results
The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results
with ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. The team’s approach was
applied separately to each food scene. A one-shot food volume estimation approach was used if
the number of keyframes k equaled 1; otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation was applied.
Notably, the keyframe selection process chose 34.8% of the total frames for the rest of the pipeline,
showing the minimum frames with the highest information.

After finding keyframes, PixSfM estimated the poses and point cloud. After generating scaled meshes,
the team calculated volumes and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Meshes
were registered with ground truth meshes using ICP to obtain transformation metrics.
Table 3 presents quantitative comparisons of the team’s volumes and Chamfer distance with and
without estimated transformation metrics from ICP. For overall method performance, Table 4 shows
the MAPE and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics.
Additionally, qualitative results on one- and few-shot 3D reconstruction from the challenge dataset
are shown. The model excels in texture details, artifact correction, missing data handling, and color
adjustment across different scene parts.
Limitations: Despite promising results, several limitations need to be addressed in future work:
• Manual processes: The current pipeline includes manual steps like providing segmentation
prompts and identifying scaling factors, which should be automated to enhance efficiency.
• Input requirements: The method requires extensive input information, including food
masks and depth data. Streamlining these inputs would simplify the process and increase
applicability.
• Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
• Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
• Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

Second Place Team - ININ-VIAUN
5.1
Methodology
This section details the team’s proposed network, illustrating the step-by-step process from original
images to final mesh models.
5.1.1
Scale factor estimation
The procedure for estimating the scale factor at the coordinate level is illustrated in Figure 9. The
team adheres to a method involving corner projection matching. Specifically, utilizing the COLMAP
dense model, the team acquires the pose of each image along with dense point cloud data. For any
given image imgk and its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team initially performs threshold-based
corner detection, setting the threshold at 240. This step allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates
of all detected corners. Subsequently, using the intrinsic parameters k and the extrinsic parameters
[R|t]k, the point cloud is projected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the
corners, the team can identify the closest point coordinates P k
i for each corner, where i represents the
index of the corner. Thus, they can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:
Dk
ij = (P k
i −P k
j )2
∀i ̸= j
(3)
To determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the
minimum value of each row of the matrix Dk (excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The
median of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by Equation 4, where
0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):
scale =
0.012
Pn
i=1 med(dk)
(4)
7
5.1.2
3D Reconstruction
The 3D reconstruction process, depicted in Figure 10, involves two different pipelines to accommodate
variations in input viewpoints. The first fifteen objects are processed using one pipeline, while the
last five single-view objects are processed using another.
For the initial fifteen objects, the team uses COLMAP to estimate poses and segment the food using
the provided segment masks. Advanced multi-view 3D reconstruction methods are then applied to
reconstruct the segmented food. The team employs three different reconstruction methods: COLMAP,
DiffusioNeRF, and NeRF2Mesh. They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and
extract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimization
techniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.
For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction
methods, including Zero123, Zero123++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They choose
ZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. The
intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method based
on reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations in
single-view reconstruction, depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular
image are used to determine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, optimization techniques are
applied to obtain a refined mesh.
5.1.3
Mesh refinement
During the 3D Reconstruction phase, it was observed that the model’s results often suffered from low
quality due to holes on the object’s surface and substantial noise, as shown in Figure 11.
To address the holes, MeshFix, an optimization method based on computational geometry, is em-
ployed. For surface noise, Laplacian Smoothing is used for mesh smoothing operations. The
Laplacian Smoothing method adjusts the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring
vertices:
V (new)
i
= V (old)
i
+ λ


1
|N(i)|
X
j∈N(i)
V (old)
j
−V (old)
i


(5)
In their implementation, the smoothing factor λ is set to 0.2, and 10 iterations are performed.
5.2
Experimental Results
5.2.1
Estimated scale factor
The scale factors estimated using the described method are shown in Table 5. Each image and the
corresponding reconstructed 3D model yield a scale factor, and the table presents the average scale
factor for each object.
5.2.2
Reconstructed meshes
The refined meshes obtained using the described methods are shown in Figure 12. The predicted
model volumes, ground truth model volumes, and the percentage errors between them are presented
in Table 6.
5.2.3
Alignment
The team designs a multi-stage alignment method for evaluating reconstruction quality. Figure 13
illustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the central points of both the predicted and
ground truth models are calculated, and the predicted model is moved to align with the central point
of the ground truth model. Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain
the final transformation matrix.
The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.

Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle
6.1
Methodology
To achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as
depicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-
motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,
a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh
quality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to
facilitate model generation.
6.1.1
Multi-View Reconstruction
For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating
SuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited
keypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.
In the mesh reconstruction phase, the team’s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which
employs a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion
9
and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to
produce a dense point cloud.
During post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline
of the supporting surface, and projected the lower mesh vertices onto this surface. They utilized
the reconstructed checkerboard to correct the model’s scale and employed Poisson reconstruction to
create a complete, watertight mesh of the subject.
6.1.2
Single-View Reconstruction
For 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team utilized advanced methods such as LGM, Instant
Mesh, and One-2-3-45 to generate an initial mesh. This initial mesh was then refined in conjunction
with depth structure information.
To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object’s length using the checkerboard as a reference,
assuming that the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D
object back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.
6.2
Experimental Results
Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that
minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization
aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion
of this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects
amounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for
both multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.

Conclusion
This report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshop
challenge on 3D Food Reconstruction. The challenge sought to enhance 3D reconstruction methods
by concentrating on food items, tackling the distinct difficulties presented by varied textures, reflective
surfaces, and intricate geometries common in culinary subjects.
The competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing
numbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc-
tion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy
through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance
metric.

Interpreting Noun-Noun Compounds
Abstract
This study examines the effectiveness of transfer learning and multi-task learning
in the context of a complex semantic classification problem: understanding the
meaning of noun-noun compounds. Through a series of detailed experiments and
an in-depth analysis of errors, we demonstrate that employing transfer learning by
initializing parameters and multi-task learning through parameter sharing enables a
neural classification model to better generalize across a dataset characterized by a
highly uneven distribution of semantic relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate
how utilizing dual annotations, which involve two distinct sets of relations applied
to the same compounds, can enhance the overall precision of a neural classifier and
improve its F1 scores for less common yet more challenging semantic relations.

Introduction
Noun-noun compound interpretation involves determining the semantic connection between two
nouns (or noun phrases in multi-word compounds). For instance, in the compound ""street protest,""
the task is to identify the semantic relationship between ""street"" and ""protest,"" which is a locative
relation in this example. Given the prevalence of noun-noun compounds in natural language and its
significance to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question answering and information
retrieval, understanding noun-noun compounds has been extensively studied in theoretical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.
In computational linguistics, noun-noun compound interpretation is typically treated as an automatic
classification task. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms and models, such as Maximum
Entropy, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, have been employed to decipher the
semantics of nominal compounds. These models utilize information from lexical semantics, like
WordNet-based features, and distributional semantics, such as word embeddings. However, noun-
noun compound interpretation remains a challenging NLP problem due to the high productivity
of noun-noun compounding as a linguistic structure and the difficulty in deriving the semantics of
noun-noun compounds from their constituents. Our research contributes to advancing NLP research
on noun-noun compound interpretation through the application of transfer and multi-task learning.
The application of transfer learning (TL) and multi-task learning (MTL) in NLP has gained significant
attention in recent years, yielding varying outcomes based on the specific tasks, model architectures,
and datasets involved. These varying results, combined with the fact that neither TL nor MTL has
been previously applied to noun-noun compound interpretation, motivate our thorough empirical
investigation into the use of TL and MTL for this task. Our aim is not only to add to the existing
research on the effectiveness of TL and MTL for semantic NLP tasks generally but also to ascertain
their specific advantages for compound interpretation.
A key reason for utilizing multi-task learning is to enhance generalization by making use of the
domain-specific details present in the training data of related tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that
TL and MTL can serve as a form of regularization, enabling the prediction of infrequent relations
within a dataset marked by a highly skewed distribution of relations. This dataset is particularly
well-suited for TL and MTL experimentation, as elaborated in Section 3.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1. Through meticulous analysis of results, we discover that TL and MTL, especially when applied
to the embedding layer, enhance overall accuracy and F1 scores for less frequent relations in a
highly skewed dataset, compared to a robust single-task learning baseline. 2. Although our research
concentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on the
relatively recent dataset from Fares (2016).

Related Work
Approaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compound
relations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. For
instance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification.
Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed,
predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We center
our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
Several recent studies have conducted extensive experiments on the application of TL and MTL to a
variety of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, semantic labeling, sentence-level sentiment
classification, super-tagging, chunking, and semantic dependency parsing. The consensus among
these studies is that the advantages of TL and MTL are largely contingent on the characteristics of the
tasks involved, including the unevenness of the data distribution, the semantic relatedness between
the source and target tasks, the learning trajectory of the auxiliary and main tasks (where target tasks
that quickly reach a plateau benefit most from non-plateauing auxiliary tasks), and the structural
similarity between the tasks. Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementioned
studies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies in
that we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds using
the same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experiment
with initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a single
MTL model on two sets of relations.
3
Task Definition and Dataset
The objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairs
of nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity of
this task is influenced by factors such as the label set used and its distribution. For the experiments
detailed in this paper, we utilize a noun-noun compounds dataset that features compounds annotated
with two distinct taxonomies of relations. This means that each noun-noun compound is associated
with two different relations, each based on different linguistic theories. This dataset is derived from
established linguistic resources, including NomBank and the Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT). We chose this dataset for two primary reasons: firstly, the dual annotation of
relations on the same set of compounds is ideal for exploring TL and MTL approaches; secondly,
aligning two different annotation frameworks on the same data allows for a comparative analysis
across these frameworks.
Specifically, we use a portion of the dataset, focusing on type-based instances of two-word compounds.
The original dataset also encompasses multi-word compounds (those made up of more than two
nouns) and multiple instances per compound type. We further divide the dataset into three parts:
training, development, and test sets. Table 1 details the number of compound types and the vocabulary
size for each set, including a breakdown of words appearing in the right-most (right constituents)
and left-most (left constituents) positions. The two label sets consist of 35 PCEDT functors and 18
2
NomBank argument and adjunct relations. As discussed in Section 7.1, these label sets have a highly
uneven distribution.

Many relations in PCEDT and NomBank conceptually describe similar semantic ideas, as they are
used to annotate the semantics of the same text. For instance, the temporal and locative relations in
NomBank (ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC, respectively) and their PCEDT counterparts (TWHEN
and LOC) exhibit relatively consistent behavior across frameworks, as they annotate many of the
same compounds. However, some relations that are theoretically similar do not align well in practice.
For example, the functor AIM in PCEDT and the modifier argument ARGM-PNC in NomBank
express a somewhat related semantic concept (purpose), but there is minimal overlap between the
sets of compounds they annotate. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the semantic similarity
in the label sets, where it exists, can be leveraged through transfer and multi-task learning, especially
since the overall distribution of relations differs between the two frameworks.
4
Transfer vs. Multi-Task Learning
In this section, we employ the terminology and definitions established by Pan and Yang (2010) to
articulate our framework for transfer and multi-task learning. Our classification task can be described
in terms of all training pairs (X, Y) and a probability distribution P(X), where X represents the input
feature space, Y denotes the set of all labels, and N is the training data size. The domain of a task is
defined by X, P(X). Our goal is to learn a function f(X) that predicts Y based on the input features X.
Considering two ML tasks, Ta and Tb, we would train two distinct models to learn separate functions
fa and fb for predicting Ya and Yb in a single-task learning scenario. However, if Ta and Tb are
related, either explicitly or implicitly, TL and MTL can enhance the generalization of either or both
tasks. Two tasks are deemed related when their domains are similar but their label sets differ, or when
their domains are dissimilar but their label sets are identical. Consequently, noun-noun compound
interpretation using the dataset is well-suited for TL and MTL, as the training examples are identical,
but the label sets are distinct.
For clarity, we differentiate between transfer learning and multi-task learning in this paper, despite
these terms sometimes being used interchangeably in the literature. We define TL as the utilization of
parameters from a model trained on Ta to initialize another model for Tb. In contrast, MTL involves
training parts of the same model to learn both Ta and Tb, essentially learning one set of parameters
for both tasks. The concept is to train a single model simultaneously on both tasks, where one task
introduces an inductive bias that aids the model in generalizing over the main task. It is important to
note that this does not necessarily imply that we aim to use a single model to predict both label sets
in practice.
5
Neural Classification Models
This section introduces the neural classification models utilized in our experiments. To discern the
impact of TL and MTL, we initially present a single-task learning model, which acts as our baseline.
Subsequently, we employ this same model to implement TL and MTL.
5.1
Single-Task Learning Model
In our single-task learning (STL) configuration, we train and fine-tune a feed-forward neural network
inspired by the neural classifier proposed by Dima and Hinrichs (2015). This network comprises four
layers: 1) an input layer, 2) an embedding layer, 3) a hidden layer, and 4) an output layer. The input
3
layer consists of two integers that indicate the indices of a compound’s constituents in the embedding
layer, where the word embedding vectors are stored. These selected vectors are then passed to a fully
connected hidden layer, the size of which matches the dimensionality of the word embedding vectors.
Finally, a softmax function is applied to the output layer to select the most probable relation.
The compound’s constituents are represented using a 300-dimensional word embedding model trained
on an English Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword Fifth Edition. The embedding model was
trained by Fares et al. (2017). If a word is not found during lookup in the embedding model, we
check if the word is uppercased and attempt to find the lowercase version. For hyphenated words
not found in the embedding vocabulary, we split the word at the hyphen and average the vectors of
its parts, if they are present in the vocabulary. If the word remains unrepresented after these steps, a
designated vector for unknown words is employed.
5.1.1
Architecture and Hyperparameters
Our selection of hyperparameters is informed by multiple rounds of experimentation with the single-
task learning model, as well as the choices made by prior work. The weights of the embedding layer
are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the model’s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
and MTL models are trained using the same hyperparameters as the STL model.
5.2
Transfer Learning Models
In our experiments, transfer learning involves training an STL model on PCEDT relations and then
using some of its weights to initialize another model for NomBank relations. Given the neural
classifier architecture detailed in Section 5.1, we identify three ways to implement TL: 1) TLE:
Transferring the embedding layer weights, 2) TLH: Transferring the hidden layer weights, and 3)
TLEH: Transferring both the embedding and hidden layer weights. Furthermore, we differentiate
between transfer learning from PCEDT to NomBank and vice versa. This results in six setups,
as shown in Table 2. We do not apply TL (or MTL) to the output layer because it is task- or
dataset-specific.
5.3
Multi-Task Learning Models
In MTL, we train a single model to simultaneously learn both PCEDT and NomBank relations,
meaning all MTL models have two objective functions and two output layers. We implement two
MTL setups: MTLE, which features a shared embedding layer but two task-specific hidden layers,
and MTLF, which has no task-specific layers aside from the output layer (i.e., both the embedding
and hidden layers are shared). We distinguish between the auxiliary and main tasks based on which
validation accuracy (NomBank’s or PCEDT’s) is monitored by the early stopping criterion. This
leads to a total of four MTL models, as shown in Table 3.
6
Experimental Results
Tables 2 and 3 display the accuracies of the various TL and MTL models on the development and test
splits for NomBank and PCEDT. The top row in both tables indicates the accuracy of the STL model.
All models were trained solely on the training split. Several insights can be gleaned from these
tables. Firstly, the accuracy of the STL models decreases when evaluated on the test split for both
NomBank and PCEDT. Secondly, all TL models achieve improved accuracy on the NomBank test
split, although transfer learning does not significantly enhance accuracy on the development split of
the same dataset. The MTL models, especially MTLF, have a detrimental effect on the development
accuracy of NomBank, yet we observe a similar improvement, as with TL, on the test split. Thirdly,
both TL and MTL models demonstrate less consistent effects on PCEDT (on both development and
test splits) compared to NomBank. For instance, all TL models yield an absolute improvement of
4
about 1.25 points in accuracy on NomBank, whereas in PCEDT, TLE clearly outperforms the other
two TL models (TLE improves over the STL accuracy by 1.37 points).

Overall, the STL models’ accuracy declines when tested on the NomBank and PCEDT test splits,
compared to their performance on the development split. This could suggest overfitting, especially
since our stopping criterion selects the model with the best performance on the development split.
Conversely, TL and MTL enhance accuracy on the test splits, despite using the same stopping criterion
as STL. We interpret this as an improvement in the models’ ability to generalize. However, since
these improvements are relatively minor, we further analyze the results to understand if and how TL
and MTL are beneficial.
7
Results Analysis
This section provides a detailed analysis of the models’ performance, drawing on insights from the
dataset and the classification errors made by the models. The discussion in the following sections is
primarily based on the results from the test split, as it is larger than the development split.
7.1
Relation Distribution
To illustrate the complexity of the task, we depict the distribution of the most frequent relations in
NomBank and PCEDT across the three data splits in Figure 1. Notably, approximately 71.18% of the
relations in the NomBank training split are of type ARG1 (prototypical patient), while 52.20% of the
PCEDT relations are of type RSTR (an underspecified adnominal modifier). Such a highly skewed
distribution makes learning some of the other relations more challenging, if not impossible in certain
cases. In fact, out of the 15 NomBank relations observed in the test split, five are never predicted
by any of the STL, TL, or MTL models. Similarly, of the 26 PCEDT relations in the test split, only
six are predicted. However, the unpredicted relations are extremely rare in the training split (e.g., 23
PCEDT functors appear less than 20 times), making it doubtful whether any ML model could learn
them under any circumstances.
Given this imbalanced distribution, it is evident that accuracy alone is insufficient to determine the
best-performing model. Therefore, in the subsequent section, we report and analyze the F1 scores of
the predicted NomBank and PCEDT relations across all STL, TL, and MTL models.
7.2
Per-Relation F1 Scores
Tables 4 and 5 present the per-relation F1 scores for NomBank and PCEDT, respectively. We only
include results for relations that are actually predicted by at least one of the models.

Several noteworthy patterns emerge from Tables 4 and 5. Firstly, the MTLF model appears to be
detrimental to both datasets, leading to significantly degraded F1 scores for four NomBank relations,
including the locative modifier ARGM-LOC and the manner modifier ARGM-MNR (abbreviated as
LOC and MNR in Table 4), which the model fails to predict altogether. This same model exhibits
the lowest F1 score compared to all other models for two PCEDT relations: REG (expressing a
circumstance) and PAT (patient). Considering that the MTLF model achieves the highest accuracy
on the NomBank test split (as shown in Table 3), it becomes even more apparent that relying solely
on accuracy scores is inadequate for evaluating the effectiveness of TL and MTL for this task and
dataset.
Secondly, with the exception of the MTLF model, all TL and MTL models consistently improve
the F1 score for all PCEDT relations except PAT. Notably, the F1 scores for the relations TWHEN
and ACT show a substantial increase compared to other PCEDT relations when only the embedding
layer’s weights are shared (MTLE) or transferred (TLE). This outcome can be partially understood
by examining the correspondence matrices between NomBank arguments and PCEDT functors,
presented in Tables 7 and 6. These tables illustrate how PCEDT functors map to NomBank arguments
in the training split (Table 6) and vice versa (Table 7). Table 6 reveals that 80% of the compounds
annotated as TWHEN in PCEDT were annotated as ARGM-TMP in NomBank. Additionally, 47% of
ACT (Actor) relations map to ARG0 (Proto-Agent) in NomBank. While this mapping is not as distinct
as one might hope, it is still relatively high when compared to how other PCEDT relations map to
ARG0. The correspondence matrices also demonstrate that the presumed theoretical similarities
between NomBank and PCEDT relations do not always hold in practice. Nevertheless, even such
imperfect correspondences can provide a training signal that assists the TL and MTL models in
learning relations like TWHEN and ACT.
Since the TLE model outperforms STL in predicting REG by ten absolute points, we examined
all REG compounds correctly classified by TLE but misclassified by STL. We found that STL
misclassified them as RSTR, indicating that TL from NomBank helps TLE recover from STL’s
overgeneralization in RSTR prediction.
The two NomBank relations that receive the highest boost in F1 score (about five absolute points)
are ARG0 and ARGM-MNR, but the improvement in the latter corresponds to only one additional
compound, which might be a chance occurrence. Overall, TL and MTL from NomBank to PCEDT
are more helpful than the reverse. One explanation is that five PCEDT relations (including the four
most frequent ones) map to ARG1 in NomBank in more than 60% of cases for each relation, as seen
in the first rows of Tables 6 and 7. This suggests that the weights learned to predict PCEDT relations

offer little to no inductive bias for NomBank relations. Conversely, the mapping from NomBank to
PCEDT shows that although many NomBank arguments map to RSTR in PCEDT, the percentages
are lower, making the mapping more diverse and discriminative, which seems to aid TL and MTL
models in learning less frequent PCEDT relations.
To understand why the PCEDT functor AIM is never predicted despite being more frequent than
TWHEN, we found that AIM is almost always misclassified as RSTR by all models. Furthermore,
AIM and RSTR have the highest lexical overlap in the training set among all PCEDT relation pairs:
78.35% of left constituents and 73.26% of right constituents of compounds annotated as AIM occur
in other compounds annotated as RSTR. This explains the models’ inability to learn AIM but raises
questions about their ability to learn relational representations, which we explore further in Section
7.3.

Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of TL and MTL for NomBank and PCEDT, we report the F1
macro-average scores in Table 8. This is arguably the appropriate evaluation measure for imbalanced
classification problems. Note that relations not predicted by any model are excluded from the macro-
average calculation. Table 8 clearly shows that TL and MTL on the embedding layer yield significant
improvements for PCEDT, with about a 7-8 point increase in macro-average F1, compared to just
0.65 in the best case for NomBank.

7.3
Generalization on Unseen Compounds
We now analyze the models’ ability to generalize to compounds not seen during training. Recent
research suggests that gains in noun-noun compound interpretation using word embeddings and
similar neural classification models might be due to lexical memorization. In other words, the models
learn that specific nouns are strong indicators of specific relations. To assess the role of lexical
memorization in our models, we quantify the number of unseen compounds that the STL, TL, and
MTL models predict correctly.
We differentiate between ’partly’ and ’completely’ unseen compounds. A compound is ’partly’
unseen if one of its constituents (left or right) is not present in the training data. A ’completely’
unseen compound is one where neither the left nor the right constituent appears in the training data.
Overall, nearly 20% of the compounds in the test split have an unseen left constituent, about 16%
have an unseen right constituent, and 4% are completely unseen. Table 9 compares the performance
of the different models on these three groups in terms of the proportion of compounds misclassified
in each group.

Table 9 shows that Transfer Learning (TL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approaches reduce
generalization error in NomBank across all scenarios, with the exception of TLH and TLEH for
completely unseen compounds, where error increases. The greatest error reductions are achieved
by MTL models across all three types of unseen compounds. Specifically, MTLE reduces the error
by approximately six points for compounds with unseen right constituents and by eleven points for
fully unseen compounds. Moreover, MTLF reduces the error by five points when the left constituent
is unseen. It’s important to interpret these results in conjunction with the Count row in Table 9 for
a comprehensive view. For example, the eleven-point error decrease in fully unseen compounds
represents eight compounds. In PCEDT, the largest error reduction is on unseen left constituents,
which is about 1.14 points, corresponding to four compounds; it’s 0.35 on unseen right constituents
(one compound) and 2.7 on fully unseen compounds, or two compounds.
Upon manual inspection of compounds that led to substantial reductions in the generalization error,
specifically within NomBank, we examined the distribution of relations within correctly predicted
unseen compound sets. Compared to the STL model, MTLE reduces generalization error for
completely unseen compounds by a total of eight compounds, of which seven are annotated with the
relation ARG1, which is the most common in NomBank. Regarding the unseen right constituents,
MTLE’s 24 improved compounds consist of 18 ARG1, 5 ARG0, and 1 ARG2 compounds. A
similar pattern arises when examining TLE model improvements, where most gains come from better
predictions of ARG1 and ARG0 relations.
A large portion of unseen compounds, whether partly or entirely unseen, that were misclassified by
every model, were not of type ARG1 in NomBank, or RSTR in PCEDT. This pattern, along with
correctly predicted unseen compounds primarily annotated with the most common relations, suggests
that classification models rely on lexical memorization to learn the compound relation interpretation.
To better comprehend lexical memorization’s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-
stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific
constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training
data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each
8
relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific
constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model
solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in
PCEDT have distinctly high ratios compared to other relations in Figure 2. These relations also
have the second-highest F1 score in their datasets—except for STL on PCEDT (see Tables 4 and
5). Lexical memorization is therefore a likely cause of these high F1 scores. We also observed that
lower ratios of relation-specific constituents correlate with lower F1 scores, such as APP and REG in
PCEDT. Based on these insights, we can’t dismiss the possibility that our models show some degree
of lexical memorization, despite manual analysis also presenting cases where models demonstrate
generalization and correct predictions in situations where lexical memorization is impossible.

Conclusion
The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in
the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error
analysis of unseen compounds.
Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding
layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,
in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity
to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.
The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound
interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or
semantic dependency parsing in PCEDT and NomBank. Future research will focus on incorporating
additional natural language processing tasks defined using these frameworks to understand noun-noun
compound interpretation using TL and MTL.

R009.pdf,"The Importance of Written Explanations in
Aggregating Crowdsourced Predictions
Abstract
This study demonstrates that incorporating the written explanations provided by
individuals when making predictions enhances the accuracy of aggregated crowd-
sourced forecasts. The research shows that while majority and weighted vote
methods are effective, the inclusion of written justifications improves forecast
accuracy throughout most of a question’s duration, with the exception of its final
phase. Furthermore, the study analyzes the attributes that differentiate reliable and
unreliable justifications.
1
Introduction
The concept of the ""wisdom of the crowd"" posits that combining information from numerous non-
expert individuals can produce answers that are as accurate as, or even more accurate than, those
provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median
estimate of an ox’s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual
weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples
demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able
to defeat the combined moves of a crowd.
In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia
relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have
garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from
large groups, it is important to determine whether the individual inputs were made independently. If
not, factors like group psychology and the influence of persuasive arguments can skew individual
judgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom.
This paper focuses on forecasts concerning questions spanning political, economic, and social
domains. Each forecast includes a prediction, estimating the probability of a particular event, and
a written justification that explains the reasoning behind the prediction. Forecasts with identical
predictions can have justifications of varying strength, which, in turn, affects the perceived reliability
of the predictions. For instance, a justification that simply refers to an external source without
explanation may appear to rely heavily on the prevailing opinion of the crowd and might be considered
weaker than a justification that presents specific, verifiable facts from external resources.
To clarify the terminology used: a ""question"" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g.,
""Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?""). Questions have a defined start and
end date, and the period between these dates constitutes the ""life"" of the question. ""Forecasters""
are individuals who provide a ""forecast,"" which consists of a ""prediction"" and a ""justification."" The
prediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justification
is the text provided by the forecaster to support their prediction. The central problem addressed in
this work is termed ""calling a question,"" which refers to the process of determining a final prediction
by aggregating individual forecasts. Two strategies are employed for calling questions each day
throughout their life: considering forecasts submitted on the given day (""daily"") and considering the
last forecast submitted by each forecaster (""active"").
Inspired by prior research on recognizing and fostering skilled forecasters, and analyzing written
justifications to assess the quality of individual or collective forecasts, this paper investigates the
automated calling of questions throughout their duration based on the forecasts available each day.
The primary contributions are empirical findings that address the following research questions:
* When making a prediction on a specific day, is it advantageous to include forecasts from previous
days? (Yes) * Does the accuracy of the prediction improve when considering the question itself
and the written justifications provided with the forecasts? (Yes) * Is it easier to make an accurate
prediction toward the end of a question’s duration? (Yes) * Are written justifications more valuable
when the crowd’s predictions are less accurate? (Yes)
In addition, this research presents an examination of the justifications associated with both accurate
and inaccurate forecasts. This analysis aims to identify the features that contribute to a justification
being more or less credible.

Related Work
The language employed by individuals is indicative of various characteristics. Prior research includes
both predictive models (using language samples to predict attributes about the author) and models
that provide valuable insights (using language samples and author attributes to identify differentiating
linguistic features). Previous studies have examined factors such as gender and age, political ideology,
health outcomes, and personality traits. In this paper, models are constructed to predict outcomes
based on crowd-sourced forecasts without knowledge of individual forecasters’ identities.
Previous research has also explored how language use varies depending on the relationships between
individuals. For instance, studies have analyzed language patterns in social networks, online commu-
nities, and corporate emails to understand how individuals in positions of authority communicate.
Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactions
and relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness,
empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current study’s focus,
researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels within
online communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, including
within the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies.
The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts,
without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics.
Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen-
tation. A strong justification for a forecast can be considered a well-reasoned supporting argument.
Previous work in this area includes identifying argument components such as claims, premises,
backing, rebuttals, and refutations, as well as mining arguments that support or oppose a particular
claim. Despite these efforts, it was found that crowdsourced justifications rarely adhere to these
established argumentation frameworks, even though such justifications are valuable for aggregating
forecasts.
Finally, several studies have focused on forecasting using datasets similar or identical to the one used
in this research. From a psychological perspective, researchers have explored strategies for enhancing
forecasting accuracy, such as utilizing top-performing forecasters (often called ""superforecasters""),
and have analyzed the traits that contribute to their success. These studies aim to identify and cultivate
superforecasters but do not incorporate the written justifications accompanying forecasts. In contrast,
the present research develops models to call questions without using any information about the
forecasters themselves. Within the field of computational linguistics, researchers have evaluated the
language used in high-quality justifications, focusing on aspects like rating, benefit, and influence.
Other researchers have developed models to predict forecaster skill using the textual justifications
from specific datasets, such as the Good Judgment Open data, and have also applied these models
to predict the accuracy of individual forecasts in other contexts, such as company earnings reports.
However, none of these prior works have specifically aimed to call questions throughout their entire
duration.

Dataset
The research utilizes data from the Good Judgment Open, a platform where questions are posted, and
individuals submit their forecasts. The questions primarily revolve around geopolitics, encompassing
areas such as domestic and international politics, the economy, and social matters. For this study, all
binary questions were collected, along with their associated forecasts, each comprising a prediction
and a justification. In total, the dataset contains 441 questions and 96,664 forecasts submitted
over 32,708 days. This dataset significantly expands upon previous research, nearly doubling the
number of forecasts analyzed. Since the objective is to accurately call questions throughout their
entire duration, all forecasts with written justifications are included, regardless of factors such as
justification length or the number of forecasts submitted by a single forecaster. Additionally, this
approach prioritizes privacy, as no information about the individual forecasters is utilized.

Table 1 provides a basic analysis of the questions in the dataset. The majority of questions are
relatively lengthy, containing more than 16 tokens and multiple named entities, with geopolitical,
person, and date entities being the most frequent. In terms of duration, half of the questions remain
open for nearly two months, and 75% are open for more than three weeks.
An examination of the topics covered by the questions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
reveals three primary themes: elections (including terms like ""voting,"" ""winners,"" and ""candidate""),
government actions (including terms like ""negotiations,"" ""announcements,"" ""meetings,"" and ""passing
(a law)""), and wars and violent crimes (including terms like ""groups,"" ""killing,"" ""civilian (casualties),""
and ""arms""). Although not explicitly represented in the LDA topics, the questions address both
domestic and international events within these broad themes.

readability scores indicate that most justifications are easily understood by high school students (11th
or 12th grade), although a substantial amount (>25%) require a college education (Flesch under 50 or
Dale-Chall over 9.0).

Table 2 presents a fundamental analysis of the 96,664 forecast justifications in the dataset. The median
length is relatively short, consisting of one sentence and 23 tokens. Justifications mention named
entities less frequently than the questions themselves. Interestingly, half of the justifications contain
at least one negation, and 25% include three or more. This suggests that forecasters sometimes base
their predictions on events that might not occur or have not yet occurred. The sentiment polarity of
3
the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores
suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full
comprehension.
Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are ""change"" (e.g., ""happen,"" ""remain,"" ""increase""), ""social"" (e.g., ""vote,"" ""support,""
""help""), ""cognition"" (e.g., ""think,"" ""believe,"" ""know""), and ""motion"" (e.g., ""go,"" ""come,"" ""leave"").
The most frequent noun classes are ""act"" (e.g., ""election,"" ""support,"" ""deal""), ""communication"" (e.g.,
""questions,"" ""forecast,"" ""news""), ""cognition"" (e.g., ""point,"" ""issue,"" ""possibility""), and ""group"" (e.g.,
""government,"" ""people,"" ""party"").

Experiments and Results
Experiments are conducted to address the challenge of accurately calling a question throughout
its duration. The input consists of the question itself and the associated forecasts (predictions and
justifications), while the output is an aggregated answer to the question derived from all forecasts.
The number of instances corresponds to the total number of days all questions were open. Both
simple baselines and a neural network are employed, considering both (a) daily forecasts and (b)
active forecasts submitted up to ten days prior.
The questions are divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Subsequently, all forecasts
submitted throughout the duration of each question are assigned to their respective subsets. It’s
important to note that randomly splitting the forecasts would be an inappropriate approach. This is
because forecasts for the same question submitted on different days would be distributed across the
training, validation, and test subsets, leading to data leakage and inaccurate performance evaluation.
4.1
Baselines
Two unsupervised baselines are considered. The ""majority vote"" baseline determines the answer to a
question based on the most frequent prediction among the forecasts. The ""weighted vote"" baseline,
on the other hand, assigns weights to the probabilities in the predictions and then aggregates them.
4.2
Neural Network Architecture
A neural network architecture is employed, which consists of three main components: one to generate
a representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTM
to process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question.
The representation of a question is obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256
neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The representation of a forecast is created by concatenating
three elements: (a) a binary flag indicating whether the forecast was submitted on the day the question
is being called or on a previous day, (b) the prediction itself (a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0),
and (c) a representation of the justification. The representation of the justification is also obtained
using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout.
The LSTM has a hidden state with a dimensionality of 256 and processes the sequence of forecasts
as its input. During the tuning process, it was discovered that providing the representation of the
question alongside each forecast is more effective than processing forecasts independently of the
question. Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation of
each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected
to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction
for the question.
4.3
Architecture Ablation
Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as
with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast
is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:
4
* Only the prediction. * The prediction and the representation of the question. * The prediction and
the representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and the
representation of the justification.
4.4
Quantitative Results
The evaluation metric used is accuracy, which represents the average percentage of days a model
correctly calls a question throughout its duration. Results are reported for all days combined, as well
as for each of the four quartiles of the question’s duration.

Despite their relative simplicity, the baseline methods achieve commendable results, demonstrating
that aggregating forecaster predictions without considering the question or justifications is a viable
strategy. However, the full neural network achieves significantly improved results.
**Using Daily or Active Forecasts** Incorporating active forecasts, rather than solely relying on
forecasts submitted on the day the question is called, proves advantageous for both baselines and all
neural network configurations, except for the one using only predictions and justifications.
**Encoding Questions and Justifications** The neural network that only utilizes the prediction
to represent a forecast surpasses both baseline methods. Notably, integrating the question, the
justification, or both into the forecast representation yields further improvements. These results
indicate that incorporating the question and forecaster-provided justifications into the model enhances
the accuracy of question calling.
**Calling Questions Throughout Their Life** When examining the results across the four quartiles of
a question’s duration, it’s observed that while using active forecasts is beneficial across all quartiles
for both baselines and all network configurations, the neural networks surprisingly outperform the
baselines only in the first three quartiles. In the last quartile, the neural networks perform significantly
worse than the baselines. This suggests that while modeling questions and justifications is generally
helpful, it becomes detrimental toward the end of a question’s life. This phenomenon can be attributed
to the increasing wisdom of the crowd as more evidence becomes available and more forecasters
contribute, making their aggregated predictions more accurate.

**Calling Questions Based on Their Difficulty** The analysis is further refined by examining
results based on question difficulty, determined by the number of days the best-performing baseline
incorrectly calls the question. This helps to understand which questions benefit most from the neural
networks that incorporate questions and justifications. However, it’s important to note that calculating
question difficulty during the question’s active period is not feasible, making these experiments
unrealistic before the question closes and the correct answer is revealed.

Qualitative Analysis
This section provides insights into the factors that make questions more difficult to forecast and
examines the characteristics of justifications associated with incorrect and correct predictions.
**Questions** An analysis of the 88 questions in the test set revealed that questions called incorrectly
on at least one day by the best model tend to have a shorter duration (69.4 days vs. 81.7 days) and a
higher number of active forecasts per day (31.0 vs. 26.7). This suggests that the model’s errors align
with the questions that forecasters also find challenging.
**Justifications** A manual review of 400 justifications (200 associated with incorrect predictions
and 200 with correct predictions) was conducted, focusing on those submitted on days when the best
model made an incorrect prediction. The following observations were made:
* A higher percentage of incorrect predictions (78%) were accompanied by short justifications
(fewer than 20 tokens), compared to 65% for correct predictions. This supports the idea that longer
user-generated text often indicates higher quality. * References to previous forecasts (either by the
same or other forecasters, or the current crowd’s forecast) were more common in justifications for
incorrect predictions (31.5%) than for correct predictions (16%). * A lack of a logical argument
was prevalent in the justifications, regardless of the prediction’s accuracy. However, it was more
frequent in justifications for incorrect predictions (62.5%) than for correct predictions (47.5%). *
Surprisingly, justifications with generic arguments did not clearly differentiate between incorrect and
correct predictions (16.0% vs. 14.5%). * Poor grammar and spelling or the use of non-English were
infrequent but more common in justifications for incorrect predictions (24.5%) compared to correct
predictions (14.5%).

Conclusions
Forecasting involves predicting future events, a capability highly valued by both governments and
industries as it enables them to anticipate and address potential challenges. This study focuses on
questions spanning the political, economic, and social domains, utilizing forecasts submitted by a
crowd of individuals without specialized training. Each forecast comprises a prediction and a natural
language justification.
6
The research demonstrates that aggregating the weighted predictions of forecasters is a solid baseline
for calling a question throughout its duration. However, models that incorporate both the question
and the justifications achieve significantly better results, particularly during the first three quartiles of
a question’s life. Importantly, the models developed in this study do not profile individual forecasters
or utilize any information about their identities. This work lays the groundwork for evaluating the
credibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that do
not require tracking individual forecasters.

R010.pdf,"Detecting Medication Usage in Parkinson’s Disease Through
Multi-modal Indoor Positioning: A Pilot Study in a Naturalistic
Environment
Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to motor symptoms, including gait
impairment. The effectiveness of levodopa therapy, a common treatment for PD, can fluctuate, causing periods of
improved mobility (""on"" state) and periods where symptoms re-emerge (""off"" state). These fluctuations impact
gait speed and increase in severity as the disease progresses. This paper proposes a transformer-based method that
uses both Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices to enhance
indoor localization accuracy. A secondary goal is to determine if indoor localization, particularly in-home gait
speed features (like the time to walk between rooms), can be used to identify motor fluctuations by detecting if a
person with PD is taking their levodopa medication or not. The method is evaluated using a real-world dataset
collected in a free-living setting, where movements are varied and unstructured. Twenty-four participants, living
in pairs (one with PD and one control), resided in a sensor-equipped smart home for five days. The results show
that the proposed network surpasses other methods for indoor localization. The evaluation of the secondary goal
reveals that accurate room-level localization, when converted into in-home gait speed features, can accurately
predict whether a PD participant is taking their medication or not.
1
Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition that affects approximately 6 million individuals globally.
It manifests through various motor symptoms, including bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and gait impairment. A
common complication associated with levodopa, the primary medication for PD, is the emergence of motor fluctuations that are
linked to medication timing. Initially, patients experience a consistent and extended therapeutic effect when starting levodopa.
However, as the disease advances, a significant portion of patients begin to experience ""wearing off"" of their medication before
the next scheduled dose, resulting in the reappearance of parkinsonian symptoms, such as slowed gait. These fluctuations in
symptoms negatively impact patients’ quality of life and often necessitate adjustments to their medication regimen. The severity
of motor symptoms can escalate to the point where they impede an individual’s ability to walk and move within their own home.
Consequently, individuals may be inclined to remain confined to a single room, and when they do move, they may require more time
to transition between rooms. These observations could potentially be used to identify periods when PD patients are experiencing
motor fluctuations related to their medication being in an ON or OFF state, thereby providing valuable information to both clinicians
and patients.
A sensitive and accurate ecologically-validated biomarker for PD progression is currently unavailable, which has contributed to
failures in clinical trials for neuroprotective therapies in PD. Gait parameters are sensitive to disease progression in unmedicated
early-stage PD and show promise as markers of disease progression, making measuring gait parameters potentially useful in clinical
trials of disease-modifying interventions. Clinical evaluations of PD are typically conducted in artificial clinic or laboratory settings,
which only capture a limited view of an individual’s motor function. Continuous monitoring could capture symptom progression,
including motor fluctuations, and sensitively quantify them over time.
While PD symptoms, including gait and balance parameters, can be measured continuously at home using wearable devices
containing inertial motor units (IMUs) or smartphones, this data does not show the context in which the measurements are taken.
Determining a person’s location within a home (indoor localization) could provide valuable contextual information for interpreting
PD symptoms. For instance, symptoms like freezing of gait and turning in gait vary depending on the environment, so knowing a
person’s location could help predict such symptoms or interpret their severity. Additionally, understanding how much time someone
spends alone or with others in a room is a step towards understanding their social participation, which impacts quality of life in
PD. Localization could also provide valuable information in the measurement of other behaviors such as non-motor symptoms like
urinary function (e.g., how many times someone visits the toilet room overnight).
IoT-based platforms with sensors capturing various modalities of data, combined with machine learning, can be used for unobtrusive
and continuous indoor localization in home environments. Many of these techniques utilize radio-frequency signals, specifically the
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), emitted by wearables and measured at access points (AP) throughout a home. These
signals estimate the user’s position based on perceived signal strength, creating radio-map features for each room. To improve
localization accuracy, accelerometer data from wearable devices, along with RSSI, can be used to distinguish different activities
(e.g., walking vs. standing). Since some activities are associated with specific rooms (e.g., stirring a pan on the stove is likely to
occur in a kitchen), accelerometer data can enhance RSSI’s ability to differentiate between adjacent rooms, an area where RSSI
alone may be insufficient.
The heterogeneity of PD, where symptoms and their severity vary between patients, poses a challenge for generalizing accelerometer
data across different individuals. Severe symptoms, such as tremors, can introduce bias and accumulated errors in accelerometer data,
particularly when collected from wrist-worn devices, which are a common and well-accepted placement location. Naively combining
accelerometer data with RSSI may degrade indoor localization performance due to varying tremor levels in the acceleration signal.
This work makes two primary contributions to address these challenges.
(1) We detail the use of RSSI, augmented by accelerometer data, to achieve room-level localization. Our proposed network
intelligently selects accelerometer features that can enhance RSSI performance in indoor localization. To rigorously assess our
method, we utilize a free-living dataset (where individuals live without external intervention) developed by our group, encompassing
diverse and unstructured movements as expected in real-world scenarios. Evaluation on this dataset, including individuals with and
without PD, demonstrates that our network outperforms other methods across all cross-validation categories.
(2) We demonstrate how accurate room-level localization predictions can be transformed into in-home gait speed biomarkers (e.g.,
number of room-to-room transitions, room-to-room transition duration). These biomarkers can effectively classify the OFF or ON
medication state of a PD patient from this pilot study data.

Related Work
Extensive research has utilized home-based passive sensing systems to evaluate how the activities and behavior of individuals with
neurological conditions, primarily cognitive dysfunction, change over time. However, there is limited work assessing room use in
the home setting in people with Parkinson’s.
Gait quantification using wearables or smartphones is an area where a significant amount of work has been done. Cameras can
also detect parkinsonian gait and some gait features, including step length and average walking speed. Time-of-flight devices,
which measure distances between the subject and the camera, have been used to assess medication adherence through gait analysis.
From free-living data, one approach to gait and room use evaluation in home settings is by emitting and detecting radio waves to
non-invasively track movement. Gait analysis using radio wave technology shows promise to track disease progression, severity, and
medication response. However, this approach cannot identify who is doing the movement and also suffers from technical issues
when the radio waves are occluded by another object. Much of the work done so far using video to track PD symptoms has focused
on the performance of structured clinical rating scales during telemedicine consultations as opposed to naturalistic behavior, and
there have been some privacy concerns around the use of video data at home.
RSSI data from wearable devices is a type of data with fewer privacy concerns; it can be measured continuously and unobtrusively
over long periods to capture real-world function and behavior in a privacy-friendly way. In indoor localization, fingerprinting using
RSSI is the typical technique used to estimate the wearable (user) location by using signal strength data representing a coarse and
noisy estimate of the distance from the wearable to the access point. RSSI signals are not stable; they fluctuate randomly due to
shadowing, fading, and multi-path effects. However, many techniques have been proposed in recent years to tackle these fluctuations
and indirectly improve localization accuracy. Some works utilize deep neural networks (DNN) to generate coarse positioning
estimates from RSSI signals, which are then refined by a hidden Markov model (HMM) to produce a final location estimate. Other
works try to utilize a time series of RSSI data and exploit the temporal connections within each access point to estimate room-level
position. A CNN is used to build localization models to further leverage the temporal dependencies across time-series readings.
It has been suggested that we cannot rely on RSSI alone for indoor localization in home environments for PD subjects due to
shadowing rooms with tight separation. Some researchers combine RSSI signals and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to test
the viability of leveraging other sensors in aiding the positioning system to produce a more accurate location estimate. Classic
machine learning approaches such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) are
tested, and the result shows that the RF outperforms other methods in tracking a person in indoor environments. Others combine
smartphone IMU sensor data and Wi-Fi-received signal strength indication (RSSI) measurements to estimate the exact location (in
Euclidean position X, Y) of a person in indoor environments. The proposed sensor fusion framework uses location fingerprinting in
combination with a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm to reduce positioning errors.
Looking at this multi-modality classification/regression problem from a time series perspective, there has been a lot of exploration
in tackling a problem where each modality can be categorized as multivariate time series data. LSTM and attention layers are
often used in parallel to directly transform raw multivariate time series data into a low-dimensional feature representation for each
modality. Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g.,
concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer
2
data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previous
work that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binary
classifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them.

Cohort and Dataset
**Dataset:** This dataset was collected using wristband wearable sensors, one on each wrist of all participants, containing tri-axial
accelerometers and 10 Access Points (APs) placed throughout the residential home, each measuring the RSSI. The wearable devices
wirelessly transmit data using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, which can be received by the 10 APs. Each AP records the
transmitted packets from the wearable sensor, which contains the accelerometer readings sampled at 30Hz, with each AP recording
RSSI values sampled at 5 Hz.
The dataset contains 12 spousal/parent-child/friend-friend pairs (24 participants in total) living freely in a smart home for five days.
Each pair consists of one person with PD and one healthy control volunteer (HC). This pairing was chosen to enable PD vs. HC
comparison, for safety reasons, and also to increase the naturalistic social behavior (particularly amongst the spousal pairs who
already lived together). From the 24 participants, five females and seven males have PD. The average age of the participants is 60.25
(PD 61.25, Control 59.25), and the average time since PD diagnosis for the person with PD is 11.3 years (range 0.5-19).
To measure the accuracy of the machine learning models, wall-mounted cameras are installed on the ground floor of the house,
which capture red-green-blue (RGB) and depth data 2-3 hours daily (during daylight hours at times when participants were at home).
The videos were then manually annotated to the nearest millisecond to provide localization labels. Multiple human labelers used
software called ELAN to watch up to 4 simultaneously-captured video files at a time. The resulting labeled data recorded the kitchen,
hallway, dining room, living room, stairs, and porch. The duration of labeled data recorded by the cameras for PD and HC is 72.84
and 75.31 hours, respectively, which provides a relatively balanced label set for our room-level classification. Finally, to evaluate
the ON/OFF medication state, participants with PD were asked to withhold their dopaminergic medications so that they were in
the practically-defined OFF medications state for a temporary period of several hours during the study. Withholding medications
removes their mitigation on symptoms, leading to mobility deterioration, which can include slowing of gait.
**Data pre-processing for indoor localization:** The data from the two wearable sensors worn by each participant were combined at
each time point, based on their modality, i.e., twenty RSSI values (corresponding to 10 APs for each of the two wearable sensors)
and accelerometry traces in six spatial directions (corresponding to the three spatial directions (x, y, z) for each wearable) were
recorded at each time point. The accelerometer data is resampled to 5Hz to synchronize the data with RSSI values. With a 5-second
time window and a 5Hz sampling rate, each RSSI data sample has an input of size (25 x 20), and accelerometer data has an input of
size (25 x 6). Imputation for missing values, specifically for RSSI data, is applied by replacing the missing values with a value that is
not possible normally (i.e., -120dB). Missing values exist in RSSI data whenever the wearable is out of range of an AP. Finally, all
time-series measurements by the modalities are normalized.
**Data pre-processing for medication state:** Our main focus is for our neural network to continuously produce room predictions,
which are then transformed into in-home gait speed features, particularly for persons with PD. We hypothesize that during their
OFF medication state, the deterioration in mobility of a person with PD is exhibited by how they transition between rooms. These
features include ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ and the ’Number of Transitions’ between two rooms. ’Number of Transitions’
represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provide
insight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the house
where participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ shows
the transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and living
room, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality across
all participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e., the time spent in the hallway) to 60 seconds to exclude
transitions likely to be prolonged and thus may not be representative of the person’s mobility.
These in-home gait speed features are produced by an indoor-localization model by feeding RSSI signals and accelerometer data
from 12 PD participants from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, which are aggregated into 4-hour windows. From this, each PD participant
will have 20 data samples (four data samples for each of the five days), each of which contains six features (three for the mean of
room-to-room transition duration and three for the number of room-to-room transitions). There is only one 4-hour window during
which the person with PD is OFF medications. These samples are then used to train a binary classifier determining whether a person
with PD is ON or OFF their medications.
For a baseline comparison to the in-home gait speed features, demographic features which include age, gender, years of PD, and
MDS-UPDRS III score (the gold-standard clinical rating scale score used in clinical trials to measure motor disease severity in
PD) are chosen. Two MDS-UPDRS III scores are assigned for each PD participant; one is assigned when a person with PD is ON
medications, and the other one is assigned when a person with PD is OFF medications. For each in-home gait speed feature data
sample, there will be a corresponding demographic feature data sample that is used to train a different binary classifier to predict
whether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications.

Methodologies and Framework
We introduce Multihead Dual Convolutional Self Attention (MDCSA), a deep neural network that utilizes dual modalities for indoor
localization in home environments. The network addresses two challenges that arise from multimodality and time-series data:
(1) Capturing multivariate features and filtering multimodal noises. RSSI signals, which are measured at multiple access points
within a home received from wearable communication, have been widely used for indoor localization, typically using a fingerprinting
technique that produces a ground truth radio map of a home. Naturally, the wearable also produces acceleration measurements which
can be used to identify typical activities performed in a specific room, and thus we can explore if accelerometer data will enrich
the RSSI signals, in particular to help distinguish adjacent rooms, which RSSI-only systems typically struggle with. If it will, how
can we incorporate these extra features (and modalities) into the existing features for accurate room predictions, particularly in the
context of PD where the acceleration signal may be significantly impacted by the disease itself?
(2) Modeling local and global temporal dynamics. The true correlations between inputs both intra-modality (i.e., RSSI signal among
access points) and inter-modality (i.e., RSSI signal against accelerometer fluctuation) are dynamic. These dynamics can affect one
another within a local context (e.g., cyclical patterns) or across long-term relationships. Can we capture local and global relationships
across different modalities?
The MDCSA architecture addresses the aforementioned challenges through a series of neural network layers, which are described in
the following sections.
4.1
Modality Positional Embedding
Due to different data dimensionality between RSSI and accelerometer, coupled with the missing temporal information, a linear
layer with a positional encoding is added to transform both RSSI and accelerometer data into their respective embeddings. Suppose
we have a collection of RSSI signals xr = [xr
1, xr
2, ..., xr
T ] ∈RT ×r and accelerometer data xa = [xa
1, xa
2, ..., xa
T ] ∈RT ×a within
T time units, where xr
t = [xr
t1, xr
t2, ..., xr
tr] represents RSSI signals from r access points, and xa
t = [xa
t1, xa
t2, ..., xa
ta] represents
accelerometer data from a spatial directions at time t with t < T. Given feature vectors xt = [xr
t, xa
t ] with u ∈{r, a} representing
RSSI or accelerometer data at time t, and t < T representing the time index, a positional embedding hu
t for RSSI or accelerometer
can be obtained by:
hu
t = (Wuxu
t + bu) + τt
(1)
where Wu ∈Ru×d and bu ∈Rd are the weight and bias to learn, d is the embedding dimension, and τt ∈Rd is the corresponding
position encoding at time t.
4.2
Locality Enhancement with Self-Attention
Since it is time-series data, the importance of an RSSI or accelerometer value at each point in time can be identified in relation to its
surrounding values - such as cyclical patterns, trends, or fluctuations. Utilizing historical context that can capture local patterns on
top of point-wise values, performance improvements in attention-based architectures can be achieved. One straightforward option is
to utilize a recurrent neural network such as a long-short term memory (LSTM) approach. However, in LSTM layers, the local
context is summarized based on the previous context and the current input. Two similar patterns separated by a long period of time
might have different contexts if they are processed by the LSTM layers. We utilize a combination of causal convolution layers and
self-attention layers, which we name Dual Convolutional Self-Attention (DCSA). The DCSA takes in a primary input ˆx1 ∈RN×d
and a secondary input ˆx2 ∈RN×d and yields:
DCSA(ˆx1, ˆx2) = GRN(Norm(ϕ(ˆx1) + ˆx1), Norm(ϕ(ˆx2) + ˆx2))
(2)
with
ϕ(ˆx) = SA(Φk(ˆx)WQ, Φk(ˆx)WK, Φk(ˆx)WV )
(3)
where GRN(.) is the Gated Residual Network to integrate dual inputs into one integrated embedding, Norm(.) is a standard layer
normalization, SA(.) is a scaled dot-product self-attention, Φk(.) is a 1D-convolutional layer with a kernel size {1, k} and a stride
of 1, WK ∈Rd×d, WQ ∈Rd×d, WV ∈Rd×d are weights for keys, queries, and values of the self-attention layer, and d is the
embedding dimension. Note that all weights for GRN are shared across each time step t.

4.3
Multihead Dual Convolutional Self-Attention
Our approach employs a self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies across time steps. It is embedded as part of the
DCSA architecture. Inspired by utilizing multihead self-attention, we utilize our DCSA with various kernel lengths with the same
aim: allowing asymmetric long-term learning. The multihead DCSA takes in two inputs ˆx1, ˆx2 ∈RN×d and yields:
MDCSAk1,...,kn(ˆx1, ˆx2) = Ξn(ϕk1,...,kn(ˆx1, ˆx2))
(4)
with
ϕki(ˆx1, ˆx2) = SA(Φki(ˆx1)WQ, Φki(ˆx2)WK, Φki(ˆx1, ˆx2)WV )
(5)
where Φki(.) is a 1D-convolutional layer with a kernel size {1, ki} and a stride ki, WK ∈Rd×d, WQ ∈Rd×d, WV ∈Rd×d are
weights for keys, queries, and values of the self-attention layer, and Ξn(.) concatenates the output of each DCSAki(.) in temporal
order. For regularization, a normalization layer followed by a dropout layer is added after Equation 4.
Following the modality positional embedding layer in subsection 4.1, the positional embeddings of RSSI hr = [hr
1, ..., hr
T ] and
accelerometer ha = [ha
1, ..., ha
T ], produced by Eq. 1, are then fed to an MDCSA layer with various kernel sizes [k1, ..., kn]:
h = MDCSAk1,...,kn(hr, ha)
(6)
to yield h = [h1, ..., hT ] with ht ∈Rd and t < T.
4.4
Final Layer and Loss Calculation
We apply two different layers to produce two different outputs during training. The room-level predictions are produced via a single
conditional random field (CRF) layer in combination with a linear layer applied to the output of Eq. 7 to produce the final predictions
as:
ˆyt = CRF(ϕ(ht))
(7)
q′(ht) = Wpht + bp
(8)
where Wp ∈Rd×m and bp ∈Rm are the weight and bias to learn, m is the number of room locations, and h = [h1, ..., hT ] ∈RT ×d
is the refined embedding produced by Eq. 7. Even though the transformer can take into account neighbor information before
generating the refined embedding at time step t, its decision is independent; it does not take into account the actual decision made by
other refined embeddings t. We use a CRF layer to cover just that, i.e., to maximize the probability of the refined embeddings of all
time steps, so it can better model cases where refined embeddings closest to one another must be compatible (i.e., minimizing the
possibility for impossible room transitions). When finding the best sequence of room location ˆyt, the Viterbi Algorithm is used as a
standard for the CRF layer.
For the second layer, we choose a particular room as a reference and perform a binary classification at each time step t. The binary
classification is produced via a linear layer applied to the refined embedding ht as:
ˆft = Wfht + bf
(9)
where Wf ∈Rd×1 and bf ∈R are the weight and bias to learn, and ˆf = [ ˆf1, ..., ˆfT ] ∈RT is the target probabilities for the
referenced room within time window T. The reason to perform a binary classification against a particular room is because of our
interest in improving the accuracy in predicting that room. In our application, the room of our choice is the hallway, where it will be
used as a hub connecting any other room.
**Loss Functions:** During the training process, the MDCSA network produces two kinds of outputs. Emission outputs (outputs
produced by Equation 9 prior to prediction outputs) ˆe = [ϕ(h1), ..., ϕ(hT )] are trained to generate the likelihood estimate of room
predictions, while the binary classification output ˆf = [ ˆf1, ..., ˆfT ] is used to train the probability estimate of a particular room. The
final loss function can be formulated as a combination of both likelihood and binary cross-entropy loss functions described as:
L(ˆe, y, ˆf, f) = LLL(ˆe, y) +
T

t=1
LBCE( ˆft, ft)

where LLL(.) represents the negative log-likelihood and LBCE(.) denotes the binary cross-entropy, y = [y1, ..., yT ] ∈RT is the
actual room locations, and f = [f1, ..., fT ] ∈RT is the binary value whether at time t the room is the referenced room or not.
P(yi|yi−1) denotes the conditional probability, and P(yt|yt−1) denotes the transition matrix cost of having transitioned from yt−1
to yt.

Experiments and Results
We compare our proposed network, MDCSA1,4,7 (MDCSA with 3 kernels of size 1, 4, and 7), with:
- Random Forest (RF) as a baseline technique, which has been shown to work well for indoor localization. - A modified transformer
encoder in combination with a CRF layer representing a model with the capability to capture global dependency and enforce
dependencies in temporal aspects. - A state-of-the-art model for multimodal and multivariate time series with a transformer encoder
to learn asymmetric correlations across modalities. - An alternative to the previous model, representing it with a GRN layer replacing
the context aggregation layer and a CRF layer added as the last layer. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS, as an ablation study, with our proposed
network (i.e., MDCSA1,4,7) using 4 access points for the RSSI (instead of 10 access points) and accelerometer data (ACCL) as its
input features. - MDCSA1,4,7 RSSI, as an ablation study, with our proposed network using only RSSI, without ACCL, as its input
features. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI, as an ablation study, with our proposed network using only 4 access points for the RSSI as its
input features.
For RF, all the time series features of RSSI and accelerometry are flattened and merged into one feature vector for room-level
localization. For the modified transformer encoder, at each time step t, RSSI xr
t and accelerometer xa
t features are combined via a
linear layer before they are processed by the networks. A grid search on the parameters of each network is performed to find the best
parameter for each model. The parameters to tune are the embedding dimension d in 128, 256, the number of epochs in 200, 300,
and the learning rate in 0.01, 0.0001. The dropout rate is set to 0.15, and a specific optimizer in combination with a Look-Ahead
algorithm is used for the training with early stopping using the validation performance. For the RF, we perform a cross-validated
parameter search for the number of trees (200, 250), the minimum number of samples in a leaf node (1, 5), and whether a warm start
is needed. The Gini impurity is used to measure splits.
**Evaluation Metrics:** We are interested in developing a system to monitor PD motor symptoms in home environments. For
example, we will consider if there is any significant difference in the performance of the system when it is trained with PD data
compared to being trained with healthy control (HC) data. We tailored our training procedure to test our hypothesis by performing
variations of cross-validation. Apart from training our models on all HC subjects (ALL-HC), we also perform four different kinds of
cross-validation: 1) We train our models on one PD subject (LOO-PD), 2) We train our models on one HC subject (LOO-HC), 3) We
take one HC subject and use only roughly four minutes’ worth of data to train our models (4m-HC), 4) We take one PD subject and
use only roughly four minutes’ worth of data to train our models (4m-PD). For all of our experiments, we test our trained models on
all PD subjects (excluding the one used as training data for LOO-PD and 4m-PD). For room-level localization accuracy, we use
precision and weighted F1-score, all averaged and standard deviated across the test folds.
To showcase the importance of in-home gait speed features in differentiating the medication state of a person with PD, we first
compare how accurate the ’Room-to-room Transition’ duration produced by each network is to the ground truth (i.e., annotated
location). We hypothesize that the more accurate the transition is compared to the ground truth, the better mobility features are for
medication state classification. For the medication state classification, we then compare two different groups of features with two
simple binary classifiers: 1) the baseline demographic features (see Section 3), and 2) the normalized in-home gait speed features.
The metric we use for ON/OFF medication state evaluation is the weighted F1-Score and AUROC, which are averaged and standard
deviated across the test folds.
5.1
Experimental Results
**Room-level Accuracy:** The first part of Table 1 compares the performance of the MDCSA network and other approaches for
room-level classification. For room-level classification, the MDCSA network outperforms other networks and RF with a minimum
improvement of 1.3% for the F1-score over the second-best network in each cross-validation type, with the exception of the ALL-HC
validation. The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with an
average improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model.
The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps will
perform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-art
model perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,
when the training data becomes limited, as in 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, having extra capabilities is necessary to further
extract temporal information and correlations. Due to being a vanilla transformer requiring a considerable amount of training
data, the modified transformer encoder performs worst in these two validations. The state-of-the-art model performs quite well
6
due to its ability to capture local context via LSTM for each modality. However, in general, its performance suffers in both the
LOO-PD and 4m-PD validations as the accelerometer data (and modality) may be erratic due to PD and should be excluded at
times from contributing to room classification. The MDCSA network has all the capabilities that the state-of-the-art model has,
with an improvement in suppressing the accelerometer modality when needed via the GRN layer embedded in DCSA. Suppressing
the noisy modality seems to have a strong impact on maintaining the performance of the network when the training data is limited.
This is validated by how the alternative to the state-of-the-art model (i.e., the state-of-the-art model with added GRN and CRF
layers) outperforms the standard state-of-the-art model by an average of 2.2% for the F1-score in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations.
It is further confirmed by MDCSA1,4,7 4APS against MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI, with the latter model, which does not include
the accelerometer data, outperforming the former for the F1-score by an average of 1.6% in the last three cross-validations. It is
worth pointing out that the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model performed the best in the 4m-PD validation. However, the omission of
accelerometer data affects the model’s ability to differentiate rooms that are more likely to have active movement (i.e., hall) than the
rooms that are not (i.e., living room). It can be seen from Table 2 that the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model has low performance in
predicting the hallway compared to the full model of MDCSA1,4,7. As a consequence, the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model cannot
produce in-home gait speed features as
accurately, as shown in Table 3.
**Room-to-room Transition and Medication Accuracy:** We hypothesize that during their OFF medication state, the deterioration
in mobility of a person with PD is exhibited by how they transition between rooms. To test this hypothesis, a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used on the annotated data from PD participants undertaking each of the three individual transitions between rooms whilst
ON (taking) and OFF (withholding) medications to assess whether the mean transition duration ON medications was statistically
significantly shorter than the mean transition duration for the same transition OFF medications for all transitions studied (see Table
4). From this result, we argue that the mean transition duration obtained by each model from Table 1 that is close to the ground truth
can capture what the ground truth captures. As mentioned in Section 3, this transition duration for each model is generated by the
model continuously performing room-level localization, focusing on the time a person is predicted to spend in a hallway between
rooms. We show, in Table 3, that the mean transition duration for all transitions studied produced by the MDCSA1,4,7 model is the
closest to the ground truth, improving over the second best by around 1.25 seconds across all hall transitions and validations.
The second part of Table 1 shows the performance of all our networks for medication state classification. The demographic
features can be used as a baseline for each type of validation. The MDCSA network, with the exception of the ALL-HC validation,
outperforms any other network by a significant margin for the AUROC score. By using in-home gait speed features produced by
the MDCSA network, a minimum of 15% improvement over the baseline demographic features can be obtained, with the biggest
gain obtained in the 4m-PD validation data. In the 4m-PD validation data, RF, TENER, and DTML could not manage to provide
any prediction due to their inability to capture (partly) hall transitions. Furthermore, TENER has shown its inability to provide any
medication state prediction from the 4m-HC data validations. It can be validated by Table 3 when TENER failed to capture any
transitions between the dining room and living room across all periods that have ground truths. MDCSA networks can provide
medication state prediction and maintain their performance across all cross-validations thanks to the addition of Eq. 13 in the loss
function.
**Limitations and future research:** One limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size (which was planned as this is
an exploratory pilot study). We believe our sample size is ample to show proof of concept. This is also the first such work with
unobtrusive ground truth validation from embedded cameras. Future work should validate our approach further on a large cohort
of people with PD and consider stratifying for sub-groups within PD (e.g., akinetic-rigid or tremor-dominant phenotypes), which
would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart home’s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
undertake scripted activities such as moving from room to room) to fully validate the performance of our approach in other settings.

Conclusion
We have presented the MDCSA model, a new deep learning approach for indoor localization utilizing RSSI and wrist-worn
accelerometer data. The evaluation on our unique real-world free-living pilot dataset, which includes subjects with and without PD,
shows that MDCSA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for indoor localization. The availability of accelerometer data does indeed
enrich the RSSI features, which, in turn, improves the accuracy of indoor localization.
Accurate room localization using these data modalities has a wide range of potential applications within healthcare. This could
include tracking of gait speed during rehabilitation from orthopedic surgery, monitoring wandering behavior in dementia, or
triggering an alert for a possible fall (and long lie on the floor) if someone is in one room for an unusual length of time. Furthermore,
accurate room use and room-to-room transfer statistics could be used in occupational settings, e.g., to check factory worker location.

In naturalistic settings, in-home mobility can be measured through the use of indoor localization models. We have shown, using
room transition duration results, that our PD cohort takes longer on average to perform a room transition when they withhold
medications. With accurate in-home gait speed features, a classifier model can then differentiate accurately if a person with PD is in
an ON or OFF medication state. Such changes show the promise of these localization outputs to detect the dopamine-related gait
fluctuations in PD that impact patients’ quality of life and are important in clinical decision-making. We have also demonstrated
that our indoor localization system provides precise in-home gait speed features in PD with a minimal average offset to the ground

Friedman test to first reject the null hypothesis. We then performed a pairwise statistical comparison: the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
with Holm’s alpha correction.

R011.pdf,"Addressing Popularity Bias with Popularity-Conscious Alignment and
Contrastive Learning
Abstract
Collaborative Filtering (CF) often encounters substantial difficulties with popularity bias because of the skewed
distribution of items in real-world datasets. This tendency creates a notable difference in accuracy between items
that are popular and those that are not. This discrepancy impedes the accurate comprehension of user preferences
and intensifies the Matthew effect within recommendation systems. To counter popularity bias, current methods
concentrate on highlighting less popular items or on differentiating the correlation between item representations
and their popularity. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches continue to grapple with two significant
issues: firstly, the extraction of shared supervisory signals from popular items to enhance the representations of
less popular items, and secondly, the reduction of representation separation caused by popularity bias. In this
study, we present an empirical examination of popularity bias and introduce a method called Popularity-Aware
Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, we utilize the common supervisory
signals found in popular item representations and introduce an innovative popularity-aware supervised alignment
module to improve the learning of representations for unpopular items. Furthermore, we propose adjusting the
weights in the contrastive learning loss to decrease the separation of representations by focusing on popularity.
We confirm the efficacy and logic of PAAC in reducing popularity bias through thorough experiments on three
real-world datasets.
1
Introduction
Contemporary recommender systems are essential in reducing information overload. Personalized recommendations frequently
employ collaborative filtering (CF) to assist users in discovering items that may interest them. CF-based techniques primarily
learn user preferences and item attributes by matching the representations of users with the items they engage with. Despite their
achievements, CF-based methods frequently encounter the issue of popularity bias, which leads to considerable disparities in
accuracy between items that are popular and those that are not. Popularity bias occurs because there are limited supervisory signals
for items that are not popular, which results in overfitting during the training phase and decreased effectiveness on the test set. This
hinders the precise comprehension of user preferences, thereby diminishing the variety of recommendations. Furthermore, popularity
bias can worsen the Matthew effect, where items that are already popular gain even more popularity because they are recommended
more frequently.
Two significant challenges are presented when mitigating popularity bias in recommendation systems. The first challenge is the
inadequate representation of unpopular items during training, which results in overfitting and limited generalization ability. The
second challenge, known as representation separation, happens when popular and unpopular items are categorized into distinct
semantic spaces, thereby intensifying the bias and diminishing the precision of recommendations.
2
Methodology
To overcome the current difficulties in reducing popularity bias, we introduce the Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC)
method. We utilize the common supervisory signals present in popular item representations to direct the learning of unpopular
representations, and we present a popularity-aware supervised alignment module. Moreover, we incorporate a re-weighting system
in the contrastive learning module to deal with representation separation by considering popularity.
2.1
Supervised Alignment Module
During the training process, the alignment of representations usually emphasizes users and items that have interacted, often causing
items to be closer to interacted users than non-interacted ones in the representation space. However, because unpopular items have
limited interactions, they are usually modeled based on a small group of users. This limited focus can result in overfitting, as the
representations of unpopular items might not fully capture their features.
The disparity in the quantity of supervisory signals is essential for learning representations of both popular and unpopular items.
Specifically, popular items gain from a wealth of supervisory signals during the alignment process, which helps in effectively
learning their representations. On the other hand, unpopular items, which have a limited number of users providing supervision, are
more susceptible to overfitting. This is because there is insufficient representation learning for unpopular items, emphasizing the
effect of supervisory signal distribution on the quality of representation. Intuitively, items interacted with by the same user have
some similar characteristics. In this section, we utilize common supervisory signals in popular item representations and suggest a
popularity-aware supervised alignment method to improve the representations of unpopular items.
We initially filter items with similar characteristics based on the user’s interests. For any user, we define the set of items they interact
with. We count the frequency of each item appearing in the training dataset as its popularity. Subsequently, we group items based on
their relative popularity. We divide items into two groups: the popular item group and the unpopular item group. The popularity of
each item in the popular group is higher than that of any item in the unpopular group. This indicates that popular items receive more
supervisory information than unpopular items, resulting in poorer recommendation performance for unpopular items.
To tackle the issue of insufficient representation learning for unpopular items, we utilize the concept that items interacted with by the
same user share some similar characteristics. Specifically, we use similar supervisory signals in popular item representations to
improve the representations of unpopular items. We align the representations of items to provide more supervisory information to
unpopular items and improve their representation, as follows:
LSA =
X
u∈U
1
|Iu|
X
i∈Iu
pop,j∈Iu
unpop
||f(i) −f(j)||2,
(1)
where f(·) is a recommendation encoder and hi = f(i). By efficiently using the inherent information in the data, we provide more
supervisory signals for unpopular items without introducing additional side information. This module enhances the representation of
unpopular items, mitigating the overfitting issue.
2.2
Re-weighting Contrast Module
Recent research has indicated that popularity bias frequently leads to a noticeable separation in the representation of item embeddings.
Although methods based on contrastive learning aim to enhance overall uniformity by distancing negative samples, their current
sampling methods might unintentionally worsen this separation. When negative samples follow the popularity distribution, which
is dominated by popular items, prioritizing unpopular items as positive samples widens the gap between popular and unpopular
items in the representation space. Conversely, when negative samples follow a uniform distribution, focusing on popular items
separates them from most unpopular ones, thus worsening the representation gap. Existing studies use the same weights for positive
and negative samples in the contrastive loss function, without considering differences in item popularity. However, in real-world
recommendation datasets, the impact of items varies due to dataset characteristics and interaction distributions. Neglecting this
aspect could lead to suboptimal results and exacerbate representation separation.
We propose to identify different influences by re-weighting different popularity items. To this end, we introduce re-weighting
different positive and negative samples to mitigate representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. We incorporate
this approach into contrastive learning to better optimize the consistency of representations. Specifically, we aim to reduce the risk
of pushing items with varying popularity further apart. For example, when using a popular item as a positive sample, our goal is
to avoid pushing unpopular items too far away. Thus, we introduce two hyperparameters to control the weights when items are
considered positive and negative samples.
To ensure balanced and equitable representations of items within our model, we first propose a dynamic strategy to categorize items
into popular and unpopular groups for each mini-batch. Instead of relying on a fixed global threshold, which often leads to the
overrepresentation of popular items across various batches, we implement a hyperparameter x. This hyperparameter readjusts the
classification of items within the current batch. By adjusting the hyperparameter x, we maintain a balance between different item
popularity levels. This enhances the model’s ability to generalize across diverse item sets by accurately reflecting the popularity
distribution in the current training context. Specifically, we denote the set of items within each batch as IB. And then we divide IB
into a popular group Ipop and an unpopular group Iunpop based on their respective popularity levels, classifying the top x% of items
as Ipop:
IB = Ipop ∪Iunpop, ∀i ∈Ipop ∧j ∈Iunpop, p(i) > p(j),
(2)
where Ipop ∈IB and Iunpop ∈IB are disjoint, with Ipop consisting of the top x% of items in the batch. In this work, we dynamically
divided items into popular and unpopular groups within each mini-batch based on their popularity, assigning the top 50% as popular
items and the bottom 50% as unpopular items. This radio not only ensures equal representation of both groups in our contrastive
learning but also allows items to be classified adaptively based on the batch’s current composition.
After that, we use InfoNCE to optimize the uniformity of item representations. Unlike traditional CL-based methods, we calculate
the loss for different item groups. Specifically, we introduce the hyperparameter α to control the positive sample weights between
popular and unpopular items, adapting to varying item distributions in different datasets:
2
LCL
item = α × LCL
pop + (1 −α) × LCL
unpop,
(3)
where LCL
pop represents the contrastive loss when popular items are considered as positive samples, and LCL
unpop represents the
contrastive loss when unpopular items are considered as positive samples. The value of α ranges from 0 to 1, where α = 0 means
exclusive emphasis on the loss of unpopular items LCL
unpop, and α = 1 means exclusive emphasis on the loss of popular items
LCL
pop. By adjusting α, we can effectively balance the impact of positive samples from both popular and unpopular items, allowing
adaptability to varying item distributions in different datasets.
Following this, we fine-tune the weighting of negative samples in the contrastive learning framework using the hyperparameter β.
This parameter controls how samples from different popularity groups contribute as negative samples. Specifically, we prioritize
re-weighting items with popularity opposite to the positive samples, mitigating the risk of excessively pushing negative samples
away and reducing representation separation. Simultaneously, this approach ensures the optimization of intra-group consistency. For
instance, when dealing with popular items as positive samples, we separately calculate the impact of popular and unpopular items
as negative samples. The hyperparameter β is then used to control the degree to which unpopular items are pushed away. This is
formalized as follows:
L
′
pop =
X
i∈Ipop
log
exp(h
′
ihi/τ)
P
j∈Ipop exp(h
′
ihj/τ) + β P
j∈Iunpop exp(h
′
ihj/τ),
(4)
similarly, the contrastive loss for unpopular items is defined as:
L
′
unpop =
X
i∈Iunpop
log
exp(h
′
ihi/τ)
P
j∈Iunpop exp(h
′
ihj/τ) + β P
j∈Ipop exp(h
′
ihj/τ),
(5)
where the parameter β ranges from 0 to 1, controlling the negative sample weighting in the contrastive loss. When β = 0, it means
that only intra-group uniformity optimization is performed. Conversely, when β = 1, it means equal treatment of both popular and
unpopular items in terms of their impact on positive samples. The setting of β allows for a flexible adjustment between prioritizing
intra-group uniformity and considering the impact of different popularity levels in the training. We prefer to push away items
within the same group to optimize uniformity. This setup helps prevent over-optimizing the uniformity of different groups, thereby
mitigating representation separation.
The final re-weighting contrastive objective is the weighted sum of the user objective and the item objective:
LCL = 1
2 × (LCL
item + LCL
user).
(6)
In this way, we not only achieved consistency in representation but also reduced the risk of further separating items with similar
characteristics into different representation spaces, thereby alleviating the issue of representation separation caused by popularity
bias.
2.3
Model Optimization
To reduce popularity bias in collaborative filtering tasks, we employ a multi-task training strategy to jointly optimize the classic
recommendation loss (LREC), supervised alignment loss (LSA), and re-weighting contrast loss (LCL).
L = LREC + λ1LSA + λ2LCL + λ3||Θ||2,
(7)
where Θ is the set of model parameters in LREC as we do not introduce additional parameters, λ1 and λ2 are hyperparameters that
control the strengths of the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss and the re-weighting contrastive learning loss respectively,
and λ3 is the L2 regularization coefficient. After completing the model training process, we use the dot product to predict unknown
preferences for recommendations.

Experiments
In this section, we assess the efficacy of PAAC through comprehensive experiments, aiming to address the following research
questions:
• How does PAAC compare to existing debiasing methods?
• How do different designed components play roles in our proposed PAAC?
3
• How does PAAC alleviate the popularity bias?
• How do different hyper-parameters affect the PAAC recommendation performance?
3.1
Experiments Settings
3.1.1
Datasets
In our experiments, we use three widely public datasets: Amazon-book, Yelp2018, and Gowalla. We retained users and items with a
minimum of 10 interactions.
3.1.2
Baselines and Evaluation Metrics
We implement the state-of-the-art LightGCN to instantiate PAAC, aiming to investigate how it alleviates popularity bias. We
compare PAAC with several debiased baselines, including re-weighting-based models, decorrelation-based models, and contrastive
learning-based models.
We utilize three widely used metrics, namely Recall@K, HR@K, and NDCG@K, to evaluate the performance of Top-K recommen-
dation. Recall@K and HR@K assess the number of target items retrieved in the recommendation results, emphasizing coverage. In
contrast, NDCG@K evaluates the positions of target items in the ranking list, with a focus on their positions in the list. We use
the full ranking strategy, considering all non-interacted items as candidate items to avoid selection bias during the test stage. We
repeated each experiment five times with different random seeds and reported the average scores.
3.2
Overall Performance
As shown in Table 1, we compare our model with several baselines across three datasets. The best performance for each metric
is highlighted in bold, while the second best is underlined. Our model consistently outperforms all compared methods across all
metrics in every dataset.
• Our proposed model PAAC consistently outperforms all baselines and significantly mitigates the popularity bias. Specif-
ically, PAAC enhances LightGCN, achieving improvements of 282.65%, 180.79%, and 82.89% in NDCG@20 on the
Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book datasets, respectively. Compared to the strongest baselines, PAAC delivers better
performance. The most significant improvements are observed on Yelp2018, where our model achieves an 8.70% increase
in Recall@20, a 10.81% increase in HR@20, and a 30.2% increase in NDCG@20. This improvement can be attributed
to our use of popularity-aware supervised alignment to enhance the representation of less popular items and re-weighted
contrastive learning to address representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective.
• The performance improvements of PAAC are smaller on sparser datasets. For example, on the Gowalla dataset, the
improvements in Recall@20, HR@20, and NDCG@20 are 3.18%, 5.85%, and 5.47%, respectively. This may be because,
in sparser datasets like Gowalla, even popular items are not well-represented due to lower data density. Aligning unpopular
items with these poorly represented popular items can introduce noise into the model. Therefore, the benefits of using
supervisory signals for unpopular items may be reduced in very sparse environments, leading to smaller performance
improvements.
• Regarding the baselines for mitigating popularity bias, the improvement of some is relatively limited compared to the
backbone model (LightGCN) and even performs worse in some cases. This may be because some are specifically designed
for traditional data-splitting scenarios, where the test set still follows a long-tail distribution, leading to poor generalization.
Some mitigate popularity bias by excluding item popularity information. Others use invariant learning to remove popularity
information at the representation level, generally performing better than the formers. This shows the importance of
addressing popularity bias at the representation level. Some outperform the other baselines, emphasizing the necessary to
improve item representation consistency for mitigating popularity bias.
• Different metrics across various datasets show varying improvements in model performance. This suggests that different
debiasing methods may need distinct optimization strategies for models. Additionally, we observe varying effects of PAAC
across different datasets. This difference could be due to the sparser nature of the Gowalla dataset. Conversely, our model
can directly provide supervisory signals for unpopular items and conduct intra-group optimization, consistently maintaining
optimal performance across all metrics on the three datasets.

Ablation Study
To better understand the effectiveness of each component in PAAC, we conduct ablation studies on three datasets. Table 2 presents a
comparison between PAAC and its variants on recommendation performance. Specifically, PAAC-w/o P refers to the variant where
the re-weighting contrastive loss of popular items is removed, focusing instead on optimizing the consistency of representations for
unpopular items. Similarly, PAAC-w/o U denotes the removal of the re-weighting contrastive loss for unpopular items. PAAC-w/o
A refers to the variant without the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss. It’s worth noting that PAAC-w/o A differs from

SimGCL in that we split the contrastive loss on the item side, LCL
item, into two distinct losses: LCL
pop and LCL
unpop. This approach
allows us to separately address the consistency of popular and unpopular item representations, thereby providing a more detailed
analysis of the impact of each component on the overall performance.
From Table 2, we observe that PAAC-w/o A outperforms SimGCL in most cases. This validates that re-weighting the importance of
popular and unpopular items can effectively improve the model’s performance in alleviating popularity bias. It also demonstrates the
effectiveness of using supervision signals from popular items to enhance the representations of unpopular items, providing more
opportunities for future research on mitigating popularity bias. Moreover, compared with PAAC-w/o U, PAAC-w/o P results in much
worse performance. This confirms the importance of re-weighting popular items in contrastive learning for mitigating popularity
bias. Finally, PAAC consistently outperforms the three variants, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining supervised alignment
and re-weighting contrastive learning. Based on the above analysis, we conclude that leveraging supervisory signals from popular
item representations can better optimize representations for unpopular items, and re-weighting contrastive learning allows the model
to focus on more informative or critical samples, thereby improving overall performance. All the proposed modules significantly
contribute to alleviating popularity bias.

Debias Ability
To further verify the effectiveness of PAAC in alleviating popularity bias, we conduct a comprehensive analysis focusing on the
recommendation performance across different popularity item groups. Specifically, 20% of the most popular items are labeled
’Popular’, and the rest are labeled ’Unpopular’. We compare the performance of PAAC with LightGCN, IPS, MACR, and SimGCL
using the NDCG@20 metric across different popularity groups. We use ∆to denote the accuracy gap between the two groups. We
draw the following conclusions:
• Improving the performance of unpopular items is crucial for enhancing overall model performance. Specially, on the
Yelp2018 dataset, PAAC shows reduced accuracy in recommending popular items, with a notable decrease of 20.14%
compared to SimGCL. However, despite this decrease, the overall recommendation accuracy surpasses that of SimGCL
by 11.94%, primarily due to a 6.81% improvement in recommending unpopular items. This improvement highlights the
importance of better recommendations for unpopular items and emphasizes their crucial role in enhancing overall model
performance.
5
• Our proposed PAAC significantly enhances the recommendation performance for unpopular items. Specifically, we observe
an improvement of 8.94% and 7.30% in NDCG@20 relative to SimGCL on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively.
This improvement is due to the popularity-aware alignment method, which uses supervisory signals from popular items to
improve the representations of unpopular items.
• PAAC has successfully narrowed the accuracy gap between different item groups. Specifically, PAAC achieved the smallest
gap, reducing the NDCG@20 accuracy gap by 34.18% and 87.50% on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively.
This indicates that our method treats items from different groups fairly, effectively alleviating the impact of popularity
bias. This success can be attributed to our re-weighted contrast module, which addresses representation separation from a
popularity-centric perspective, resulting in more consistent recommendation results across different groups.
3.5
Hyperparameter Sensitivities
In this section, we analyze the impact of hyperparameters in PAAC. Firstly, we investigate the influence of λ1 and λ2, which
respectively control the impact of the popularity-aware supervised alignment and re-weighting contrast loss. Additionally, in the
re-weighting contrastive loss, we introduce two hyperparameters, α and β, to control the re-weighting of different popularity items
as positive and negative samples. Finally, we explore the impact of the grouping ratio x on the model’s performance.
3.5.1
Effect of λ1 and λ2
As formulated in Eq. (11), λ1 controls the extent of providing additional supervisory signals for unpopular items, while λ2 controls
the extent of optimizing representation consistency. Horizontally, with the increase in λ2, the performance initially increases and
then decreases. This indicates that appropriate re-weighting contrastive loss effectively enhances the consistency of representation
distributions, mitigating popularity bias. However, overly strong contrastive loss may lead the model to neglect recommendation
accuracy. Vertically, as λ1 increases, the performance also initially increases and then decreases. This suggests that suitable
alignment can provide beneficial supervisory signals for unpopular items, while too strong an alignment may introduce more noise
from popular items to unpopular ones, thereby impacting recommendation performance.
3.5.2
Effect of re-weighting coefficient α and β
To mitigate representation separation due to imbalanced positive and negative sampling, we introduce two hyperparameters into the
contrastive loss. Specifically, α controls the weight difference between positive samples from popular and unpopular items, while β
controls the influence of different popularity items as negative samples.
In our experiments, while keeping other hyperparameters constant, we search α and β within the range {0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1}. As
α and β increase, performance initially improves and then declines. The optimal hyperparameters for the Yelp2018 and Gowalla
datasets are α = 0.8, β = 0.6 and α = 0.2, β = 0.2, respectively. This may be attributed to the characteristics of the datasets. The
Yelp2018 dataset, with a higher average interaction frequency per item, benefits more from a higher weight α for popular items as
positive samples. Conversely, the Gowalla dataset, being relatively sparse, prefers a smaller α. This indicates the importance of
considering dataset characteristics when adjusting the contributions of popular and unpopular items to the model.
Notably, α and β are not highly sensitive within the range [0, 1], performing well across a broad spectrum. Performance exceeds the
baseline regardless of β values when other parameters are optimal. Additionally, α values from [0.4, 1.0] on the Yelp2018 dataset
and [0.2, 0.8] on the Gowalla dataset surpass the baseline, indicating less need for precise tuning. Thus, α and β achieve optimal
performance without meticulous adjustments, focusing on weight coefficients to maintain model efficacy.
3.5.3
Effect of grouping ratio x
To investigate the impact of different grouping ratios on recommendation performance, we developed a flexible classification
method for items within each mini-batch based on their popularity. Instead of adopting a fixed global threshold, which tends to
overrepresent popular items in some mini-batches, our approach dynamically divides items in each mini-batch into popular and
unpopular categories. Specifically, the top x% of items are classified as popular and the remaining (100 - x)% as unpopular, with x
varying. This strategy prevents the overrepresentation typical in fixed distribution models, which could skew the learning process
and degrade performance. To quantify the effects of these varying ratios, we examined various division ratios for popular items,
including 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, as shown in Table 3. The preliminary results indicate that both extremely low and high ratios
negatively affect model performance, thereby underscoring the superiority of our dynamic data partitioning approach. Moreover,
within the 40%-60% range, our model’s performance remained consistently robust, further validating the effectiveness of PAAC.

Popularity Bias in Recommendation
Popularity bias is a prevalent problem in recommender systems, where unpopular items in the training dataset are seldom recom-
mended. Numerous techniques have been suggested to examine and decrease performance variations between popular and unpopular
items. These techniques can be broadly divided into three categories.
• Re-weighting-based methods aim to increase the training weight or scores for unpopular items, redirecting focus away
from popular items during training or prediction. For instance, IPS adds compensation to unpopular items and adjusts
the prediction of the user-item preference matrix, resulting in higher preference scores and improving rankings for
unpopular items. α-AdjNorm enhances the focus on unpopular items by controlling the normalization strength during the
neighborhood aggregation process in GCN-based models.
• Decorrelation-based methods aim to effectively remove the correlations between item representations (or prediction scores)
and popularity. For instance, MACR uses counterfactual reasoning to eliminate the direct impact of popularity on item
outcomes. In contrast, InvCF operates on the principle that item representations remain invariant to changes in popularity
semantics, filtering out unstable or outdated popularity characteristics to learn unbiased representations.
• Contrastive-learning-based methods aim to achieve overall uniformity in item representations using InfoNCE, preserving
more inherent characteristics of items to mitigate popularity bias. This approach has been demonstrated as a state-of-the-art
method for alleviating popularity bias. It employs data augmentation techniques such as graph augmentation or feature
augmentation to generate different views, maximizing positive pair consistency and minimizing negative pair consistency
to promote more uniform representations. Specifically, Adap-τ adjusts user/item embeddings to specific values, while
SimGCL integrates InfoNCE loss to enhance representation uniformity and alleviate popularity bias.
4.2
Representation Learning for CF
Representation learning is crucial in recommendation systems, especially in modern collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. It
creates personalized embeddings that capture user preferences and item characteristics. The quality of these representations critically
determines a recommender system’s effectiveness by precisely capturing the interplay between user interests and item features.
Recent studies emphasize two fundamental principles in representation learning: alignment and uniformity. The alignment principle
ensures that embeddings of similar or related items (or users) are closely clustered together, improving the system’s ability to
recommend items that align with a user’s interests. This principle is crucial when accurately reflecting user preferences through
corresponding item characteristics. Conversely, the uniformity principle ensures a balanced distribution of all embeddings across the
representation space. This approach prevents the over-concentration of embeddings in specific areas, enhancing recommendation
diversity and improving generalization to unseen data.
In this work, we focus on aligning the representations of popular and unpopular items interacted with by the same user and re-
weighting uniformity to mitigate representation separation. Our model PAAC uniquely addresses popularity bias by combining group
alignment and contrastive learning, a first in the field. Unlike previous works that align positive user-item pairs or contrastive pairs,
PAAC directly aligns popular and unpopular items, leveraging the rich information of popular items to enhance the representations
of unpopular items and reduce overfitting. Additionally, we introduce targeted re-weighting from a popularity-centric perspective to
achieve a more balanced representation.
5
Conclusion
In this study, we have examined popularity bias and put forward PAAC as a method to lessen its impact. We postulated that items
engaged with by the same user exhibit common traits, and we utilized this insight to coordinate the representations of both popular
and unpopular items via a popularity-conscious supervised alignment method. This strategy furnished additional supervisory data for
less popular items. It is important to note that our concept of aligning and categorizing items according to user-specific preferences
introduces a fresh perspective on alignment. Moreover, we tackled the problem of representation separation seen in current CL-based
7
models by incorporating two hyperparameters to regulate the influence of items with varying popularity levels when considered
as positive and negative samples. This method refined the uniformity of representations and successfully reduced separation. We
validated our method, PAAC, on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and underlying rationale.
In the future, we will explore deeper alignment and contrast adjustments tailored to specific tasks to further mitigate popularity
bias. We aim to investigate the synergies between alignment and contrast and extend our approach to address other biases in
recommendation systems.

Introduction
The increasing adoption of machine learning models, such as neural networks, in safety-critical
applications, such as autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance, highlights an urgent
need for the development of guarantees on safety and robustness. These models may be required
to satisfy specific input-output specifications to ensure the algorithms comply with physical laws,
can be executed safely, and are consistent with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, these models
should demonstrate adversarial robustness, meaning their outputs should not change abruptly within
small input regions – a property that neural networks often fail to satisfy.
Recent studies have shown the capacity to verify formally input-output specifications and adversarial
robustness properties of neural networks. For instance, the Satisability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver
Reluplex was employed to verify properties of networks being used in the Next-Generation Aircraft
Collision Avoidance System for Unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Reluplex has also been used to
verify adversarial robustness. While Reluplex and other similar techniques can effectively determine
if a network satisfies a given specification, they do not offer a way to guarantee that the network will
meet those specifications. Therefore, additional methods are needed to adjust networks if it is found
that they are not meeting the desired properties.
There has been an increase in techniques for designing networks with certified adversarial robustness,
but enforcing more general safety properties in neural networks is still largely unexplored. One ap-
proach to achieving provably correct neural networks is through abstraction-refinement optimization.
This approach has been applied to the ACAS-Xu dataset, but the network was not guaranteed to meet
the specifications until after training. Our work seeks to design networks with enforced input-output
constraints even before training has been completed. This will allow for online learning scenarios
where a system has to guarantee safety throughout its operation.
This paper presents an approach for designing a safe predictor (a neural network or any other
machine learning model) that will always meet a set of constraints on the input-output relationship.
This assumes that the constrained output regions can be formulated to be convex. Our correct-
by-construction safe predictor is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints, even before training, and at
every training step. We describe our approach in Section 2, and show its use in an aircraft collision
avoidance problem in Section 3. Results on synthetic datasets can be found in Appendix B.

Method
Considering two normed vector spaces, an input space X and an output space Y , and a collection
of c different pairs of input-output constraints, (Ai, Bi), where Ai ⊆X and Bi is a convex subset
of Y for each constraint i, the goal is to design a safe predictor, F : X →Y , that guarantees
x ∈Ai ⇒F(x) ∈Bi.
Let b be a bit-string of length c. Define Ob as the set of points z such that, for all i, bi = 1 implies
z ∈Ai, and bi = 0 implies z /∈Ai. Ob thus represents the overlap regions for each combination of
input constraints. For example, O101 is the set of points in A1 and A3, but not in A2, and O0...0 is
the set where no input constraints apply. We also define O as the set of bit strings, b, such that Ob
is non-empty, and define k = |O|. The sets {Ob : b ∈O} create a partition of X according to the
combination of input constraints that apply.
Given:
• c different input constraint proximity functions, σi : X →[0, 1], where σi is continuous and
∀x ∈Ai, σi(x) = 0,
• k different constrained predictors, Gb : X →Bb, one for each b ∈O, such that the domain
of each Gb is non-empty,
We define:
• a set of weighting functions, wb(x)
=
Q
i:bi=1(1−σi(x)) Q
i:bi=0 σi(x)
P
b∈O
Q
i:bi=1(1−σi(x)) Q
i:bi=0 σi(x), where
P
b∈O wb(x) = 1, and
• a safe predictor, F(x) = P
b∈O wb(x)Gb(x).
Theorem 2.1. For all i, if x ∈Ai, then F(x) ∈Bi.
A formal proof of Theorem 2.1 is presented in Appendix A and can be summarized as: if an input is
in Ai, then by construction of the proximity and weighting functions, all of the constrained predictors,
Gb, that do not map to Bi will be given zero weight. Only the constrained predictors that map to
Bi will be given non-zero weight, and because of the convexity of Bi, the weighted average of the
predictions will remain in Bi.
If all Gb are continuous and if there are no two input sets, Ai and Aj, for which (Ai ∩Aj) ⊂
(∂Ai∪∂Aj), then F will be continuous. In the worst case, as the number of constraints grows linearly,
the number of constrained predictors needed to describe our safe predictor grows exponentially. In
practice, however, we expect many of the constraint overlap sets, Ob, to be empty. Consequently, any
predictors corresponding to an empty set can be ignored. This significantly reduces the number of
constrained predictors needed for many applications.
See Figure 1 for an illustrative example of how to construct F(x) for a notional problem with two
overlapping input-output constraints.
2.1
Proximity Functions
The proximity functions, σi, describe how close an input, x, is to a particular input constraint region,
Ai. These functions are used to compute the weights of the constrained predictors. A desirable
property for σi is for σi(x) →1 as d(x, Ai) →∞, for some distance function. This ensures that
when an input is far from a constraint region, that constraint has little influence on the prediction for
that input. A natural choice for such a function is:
σi(x; Σi) = 1 −exp

−d(x, Ai)
σ1
σ2
.
Here, Σi is a set of parameters σ1 ∈(0, ∞) and σ2 ∈(1, ∞), which can be specified based on
engineering judgment, or learned using optimization over training data. In our experiments in
this paper, we use proximity functions of this form and learn independent parameters for each
input-constrained region. We plan to explore other choices for proximity functions in future work.
2
2.2
Learning
If we have families of differentiable functions Gb(x; θb), continuously parameterized by θb, and
families of σi(x; χi), differentiable and continuously parameterized by χi, then F(x; Θ, X), where
Θ = {θb : b ∈O} and X = {χi : i = 1, ..., c}, is also continuously parameterized and differentiable.
We can thus apply standard optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent) to find parameters of F
that minimize a loss function on some dataset, while also preserving the desired safety properties.
Note that the safety guarantee holds regardless of the parameters. To create each Gb(x; θb) we
consider choosing:
• a latent space Rm,
• a map hb : Rm →Bb,
• a standard neural network architecture gb : X →Rm,
and then defining Gb(x; θb) = hb(gb(x; θb)).
The framework proposed here does not require an entirely separate network for each b. In many
applications, it may be advantageous for the constrained predictors to share earlier layers, thus
creating a shared representation of the input space. In addition, our definition of the safe predictor is
general and is not limited to neural networks.
In Appendix B, we show examples of applying our approach to synthetic datasets in 2-D and 3-D
with simple neural networks. These examples show that our safe predictor can enforce arbitrary
input-output specifications using convex output constraints on neural networks, and that the learned
function is smooth.

Application to Aircraft Collision Avoidance
Aircraft collision avoidance requires robust safety guarantees. The Next-Generation Collision
Avoidance System (ACAS X), which issues advisories to prevent near mid-air collisions, has both
manned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned (ACAS Xu) variants. The system was originally designed to
choose optimal advisories while minimizing disruptive alerts by solving a partially observable Markov
decision process. The solution took the form of a large look-up table, mapping each possible input
combination to scores for all possible advisories. The advisory with the highest score would then be
issued. By using a deep neural network (DNN) to compress the policy tables, it has been necessary to
verify that the DNNs meet certain safety specifications.
A desirable ˘201csafeability˘201d property for ACAS X was defined in a previous work. This property
speci01ed that for any given input state within the ˘201csafeable region,˘201d an advisory would never
be issued that could put the aircraft into a state where a safe advisory would no longer exist. This
concept is similar to control invariance. A simplified model of the ACAS Xa system was created,
named VerticalCAS. DNNs were then generated to approximate the learned policy, and Reluplex was
used to verify whether the DNNs satisfied the safeability property. This work found thousands of
counterexamples where the DNNs did not meet the criteria.
Our approach for designing a safe predictor ensures any collision avoidance system will meet the
safeability property by construction. Appendix C describes in detail how we apply our approach to
a subset of the VerticalCAS datasets using a conservative, convex approximation of the safeability
constraints. These constraints are defined such that if an aircraft state is in the ""unsafeable region"",
Aunsafeable,i, for the ith advisory, the score for that advisory must not be the highest, i.e., x ∈
Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), where Fj(x) is the output score for the jth advisory.
Table 1 shows the performance of a standard, unconstrained network and our safe predictor. For both
networks, we present the percentage accuracy (ACC) and violations (percentage of inputs for which
the network outputs an unsafe advisory). We train and test using PyTorch with two separate datasets,
based on the previous advisory being Clear of Conflict (COC) and Climb at 1500 ft/min (CL1500).
As shown in the table, our safe predictor adheres to the required safeability property. Furthermore,
the accuracy of our predictor remains the same as the unconstrained network, demonstrating we are
not losing accuracy to achieve safety guarantees.

Discussion and Future Work
We propose an approach for designing a safe predictor that adheres to input-output specifications for
use in safety-critical machine learning systems, demonstrating it on an aircraft collision avoidance
problem. The novelty of our approach is its simplicity and guaranteed enforcement of specifications
through combinations of convex output constraints during all stages of training. Future work includes
adapting and using techniques from optimization and control barrier functions, as well as incorporating
notions of adversarial robustness into our design, such as extending the work to bound the Lipschitz
constant of our networks.
Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 2.1
Proof. Fix i and assume that x ∈Ai. It follows that σi(x) = 0, so for all b ∈O where bi = 0,
wb(x) = 0. Thus,
F(x) =
X
b∈O,bi=1
wb(x)Gb(x).
If bi = 1, Gb(x) ∈Bi, and thus F(x) is also in Bi by the convexity of Bi.
Appendix B: Example on Synthetic Datasets
Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem. This
example uses inputs and outputs in 1-D with one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network
consists of a single hidden layer with a dimension of 10, ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer.
The safe predictor shares this structure with the unconstrained network but has its own fully connected
layer for the constrained predictors, G0 and G1. Training uses a sampled subset of points from
the input space. Figure 3 shows an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression
problem with a 2-D input and 1-D output, using two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained
network has two hidden layers of dimension 20 and ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected
layer. The constrained predictors, G00, G10, G01, and G11, share the hidden layers but also have an
additional hidden layer of size 20 with ReLU, followed by a fully connected layer. Training uses a
sampled subset of points from the input space.

C.1 Safeability Constraints
The ""safeability"" property, originally introduced and used to verify the safety of the VerticalCAS
neural networks can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The ""safeable region"" for
a given advisory represents input locations where that advisory can be selected such that future
advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the advisory is ""unsafeable""
and the corresponding input region is the ""unsafeable region"". Examples of these regions, and their
proximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory.
The constraints we enforce are that x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), ∀i, where Aunsafeable,i is
the unsafeable region for the ith advisory, and Fj(x) is the output score for the jth advisory. Because
the output regions of the safeable constraints are not convex, we make a conservative approximation,
enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x), for all x ∈Aunsafeable,i.
4
C.2 Proximity Functions
We start by generating the unsafeable region bounds from the open source code. We then compute a
""distance function"" between input space points (vO - vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each
advisory. These are not true distances but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable
set. These are then used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1.
C.3 Structure of Predictors
The compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden
layers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the
unconstrained network. For our constrained predictors, we use the same structure but have shared
first four layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space,
while allowing each predictor to adapt to its own constraints. After the shared layers, each constrained
predictor has an additional two hidden layers and their final outputs are projected onto our convex
approximation of the safe region of the output space, using Gb(x) = minj Gj(x). In our experiments,
we set ϵ = 0.0001.
With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability
constraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and 2880,
respectively. Our safe predictor is orders of magnitude smaller than the original look-up tables.
C.4 Parameter Optimization
We use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both
the unconstrained and safe predictors using the asymmetric loss function to select advisories while
also accurately predicting scores. The data is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed
of 0. The optimizer is ADAM with a learning rate of 0.0003 and batch size of 216, with training for
500 epochs.
Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 2.1
Proof. Let x ∈Ai. Then, σi(x) = 0, and for all b ∈O where bi = 0, wb(x) = 0. Thus,
F(x) =
X
b∈O,bi=1
wb(x)Gb(x)
If bi = 1, then Gb(x) ∈Bi, and therefore F(x) is in Bi due to the convexity of Bi.
Appendix B: Example on Synthetic Datasets
Figure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem with 1-D
input and outputs, and one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network has a single hidden
layer of dimension 10 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The safe predictor
shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor has its own fully
connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned
predictors are shown for the continuous input space.
Figure 3 shows an example of applying the safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D
input and 1-D output and two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden
layers of dimension 20 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained
predictors G00, G10, G01 and G11 share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of size
20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of points
from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space.

C.1 Safeability Constraints
The “safeability” property from prior work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The
“safeable region” for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can be
chosen, for which future advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist for
preventing an NMAC, the advisory is deemed “unsafeable,” and the corresponding input region is the
“unsafeable region.” Figure 5 shows an example of these regions for the CL1500 advisory.
The constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈Aunsafeable,i ⇒Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x),
∀i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcing Fi(x) = minj Fj(x), for all
x ∈Aunsafeable,i.
C.2 Proximity Functions
We start by generating the bounds on the unsafeable regions. Then, a distance function is computed
between points in the input space (vO −vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. While
these are not true distances, their values are 0 if and only if the data point is inside the unsafeable set.
When used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1, these values help ensure safety.
Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function, and proximity function for the
CL1500 advisory.
C.3 Structure of Predictors
The compressed versions of the policy tables from prior work are neural networks with six hidden
layers, 45 dimensions in each layer, and ReLU activation functions. We use the same architecture
for our standard, unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture.
However, the first four hidden layers are shared between all of the predictors. This learns a single,
shared input space representation, and also allows each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each
constrained predictor has two additional hidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex
approximation of the safe output region. We accomplish this by setting the score for any unsafeable
advisory i to Gi(x) = minj Gj(x) −ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001.
To enforce the VerticalCAS safeability constraints, we need 30 separate predictors. This increases
the size of the network from 270 to 2880 nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations
respectively. However, our safe predictor remains smaller than the original look-up tables by several
orders of magnitude.
C.4 Parameter Optimization
We define our networks and perform parameter optimization using PyTorch. We optimize the
parameters of both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss
function, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from
the look-up tables. Each dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split, with a random seed of 0. The
optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and the number of training
epochs is 500.

R013.pdf,"Generalization in ReLU Networks via Restricted
Isometry and Norm Concentration
Abstract
Regression tasks, while aiming to model relationships across the entire input space,
are often constrained by limited training data. Nevertheless, if the hypothesis func-
tions can be represented effectively by the data, there is potential for identifying a
model that generalizes well. This paper introduces the Neural Restricted Isometry
Property (NeuRIPs), which acts as a uniform concentration event that ensures all
shallow ReLU networks are sketched with comparable quality. To determine the
sample complexity necessary to achieve NeuRIPs, we bound the covering numbers
of the networks using the Sub-Gaussian metric and apply chaining techniques. As-
suming the NeuRIPs event, we then provide bounds on the expected risk, applicable
to networks within any sublevel set of the empirical risk. Our results show that all
networks with sufficiently small empirical risk achieve uniform generalization.

Introduction
A fundamental requirement of any scientific model is a clear evaluation of its limitations. In recent
years, supervised machine learning has seen the development of tools for automated model discovery
from training data. However, these methods often lack a robust theoretical framework to estimate
model limitations. Statistical learning theory quantifies the limitation of a trained model by the
generalization error. This theory uses concepts such as the VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity
to analyze generalization error bounds for classification problems. While these traditional complexity
notions have been successful in classification problems, they do not apply to generic regression
problems with unbounded risk functions, which are the focus of this study. Moreover, traditional
tools in statistical learning theory have not been able to provide a fully satisfying generalization
theory for neural networks.
Understanding the risk surface during neural network training is crucial for establishing a strong
theoretical foundation for neural network-based machine learning, particularly for understanding
generalization. Recent studies on neural networks suggest intriguing properties of the risk surface.
In large networks, local minima of the risk form a small bond at the global minimum. Surprisingly,
global minima exist in each connected component of the risk’s sublevel set and are path-connected.
In this work, we contribute to a generalization theory for shallow ReLU networks, by giving uniform
generalization error bounds within the empirical risk’s sublevel set. We use methods from the analysis
of convex linear regression, where generalization bounds for empirical risk minimizers are derived
from recent advancements in stochastic processes’ chaining theory. Empirical risk minimization
for non-convex hypothesis functions cannot generally be solved efficiently. However, under certain
assumptions, it is still possible to derive generalization error bounds, as we demonstrate in this paper
for shallow ReLU networks. Existing works have applied methods from compressed sensing to
bound generalization errors for arbitrary hypothesis functions. However, they do not capture the
risk’s stochastic nature through the more advanced chaining theory.
This paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section II by outlining our assumptions about the
parameters of shallow ReLU networks and the data distribution to be interpolated. The expected and
empirical risk are introduced in Section III, where we define the Neural Restricted Isometry Property
.
(NeuRIPs) as a uniform norm concentration event. We present a bound on the sample complexity for
achieving NeuRIPs in Theorem 1, which depends on both the network architecture and parameter
assumptions. We provide upper bounds on the generalization error that are uniformly applicable
across the sublevel sets of the empirical risk in Section IV. We prove this property in a network
recovery setting in Theorem 2, and also an agnostic learning setting in Theorem 3. These results
ensure a small generalization error, when any optimization algorithm finds a network with a small
empirical risk. We develop the key proof techniques for deriving the sample complexity of achieving
NeuRIPs in Section V, by using the chaining theory of stochastic processes. The derived results are
summarized in Section VI, where we also explore potential future research directions.

Notation and Assumptions
In this section, we will define the key notations and assumptions for the neural networks examined
in this study. A Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function ϕ : R →R is given by ϕ(x) := max(x, 0).
Given a weight vector w ∈Rd, a bias b ∈R, and a sign κ ∈{±1}, a ReLU neuron is a function
ϕ(w, b, κ) : Rd →R defined as
ϕ(w, b, κ)(x) = κϕ(wT x + b).
Shallow neural networks are constructed as weighted sums of neurons. Typically they are represented
by a graph with n neurons in a single hidden layer. When using the ReLU activation function, we can
apply a symmetry procedure to represent these as sums:
¯ϕ¯p(x) =
n
X
i=0
ϕpi(x),
where ¯p is the tuple (p1, . . . , pn).
Assumption 1. The parameters ¯p, which index shallow ReLU networks, are drawn from a set
¯P ⊆(Rd × R × {±1})n.
For ¯P, we assume there exist constants cw ≥0 and cb ∈[1, 3], such that for all parameter tuples
¯p = {(w1, b1, κ1), . . . , (wn, bn, κn)} ∈¯P, we have
∥wi∥≤cw
and
|bi| ≤cb.
We denote the set of shallow networks indexed by a parameter set ¯P by
Φ ¯
P := {ϕ¯p : ¯p ∈¯P}.
We now equip the input space Rd of the networks with a probability distribution. This distribution
reflects the sampling process and makes each neural network a random variable. Additionally, a
random label y takes its values in the output space R, for which we assume the following.
Assumption 2. The random sample x ∈Rd and label y ∈R follow a joint distribution µ such that
the marginal distribution µx of sample x is standard Gaussian with density
1
(2π)d/2 exp

−∥x∥2

.
As available data, we assume independent copies {(xj, yj)}m
j=1 of the random pair (x, y), each
distributed by µ.
3
Concentration of the Empirical Norm
Supervised learning algorithms interpolate labels y for samples x, both distributed jointly by µ on
X × Y. This task is often solved under limited data accessibility. The training data, respecting
Assumption 2, consists of m independent copies of the random pair (x, y). During training, the
interpolation quality of a hypothesis function f : X →Y can only be assessed at the given random
samples {xj}m
j=1. Any algorithm therefore accesses each function f through its sketch samples
S[f] = (f(x1), . . . , f(xm)),
2
where S is the sample operator. After training, the quality of a resulting model is often measured by
its generalization to new data not used during training. With Rd × R as the input and output space,
we quantify a function f’s generalization error with its expected risk:
Eµ[f] := Eµ|y −f(x)|2.
The functional || · ||µ, also gives the norm of the space L2(Rd, µx), which consists of functions
f : Rd →R with
∥f∥2
µ := Eµx[|f(x)|2].
If the label y depends deterministically on the associated sample x, we can treat y as an element of
L2(Rd, µx), and the expected risk of any function f is the function’s distance to y. By sketching any
hypothesis function f with the sample operator S, we perform a Monte-Carlo approximation of the
expected risk, which is termed the empirical risk:
∥f∥2

(f(xj) −yj)2 =

√m(y1, . . . , ym)T −S[f]

.
The random functional || · ||m also defines a seminorm on L2(Rd, µx), referred to as the empirical
norm. Under mild assumptions, || · ||m fails to be a norm.
In order to obtain a well generalizing model, the goal is to identify a function f with a low expected
risk. However, with limited data, we are restricted to optimizing the empirical risk. Our strategy for
deriving generalization guarantees is based on the stochastic relation between both risks. If {xj}m
j=1
are independently distributed by µx, the law of large numbers implies that for any f ∈L2(Rd, µx)
the convergence
lim
m→∞∥f∥m = ∥f∥µ.
While this establishes the asymptotic convergence of the empirical norm to the function norm for a
single function f, we have to consider two issues to formulate our concept of norm concentration:
First, we need non-asymptotic results, that is bounds on the distance |∥f∥m −∥f∥µ| for a fixed
number of samples m. Second, the bounds on the distance need to be uniformly valid for all functions
f in a given set.
Sample operators which have uniform concentration properties have been studied as restricted
isometries in the area of compressed sensing. For shallow ReLU networks of the form (1), we define
the restricted isometry property of the sampling operator S as follows.
Definition 1. Let s ∈(0, 1) be a constant and ¯P be a parameter set. We say that the Neural Restricted
Isometry Property (NeuRIPs( ¯P)) is satisfied if, for all ¯p ∈¯P it holds that
(1 −s)∥ϕ¯p∥µ ≤∥ϕ¯p∥m ≤(1 + s)∥ϕ¯p∥µ.
In the following Theorem, we provide a bound on the number m of samples, which is sufficient for
the operator S to satisfy NeuRIPs( ¯P).
Theorem 1. There exist universal constants C1, C2 ∈R such that the following holds: For
any sample operator S, constructed from random samples {xj}, respecting Assumption 2, let
¯P ⊂(Rd × R × {±1})n be any parameter set satisfying Assumption 1 and ||ϕ¯p||µ > 1 for all
¯p ∈¯P. Then, for any u > 2 and s ∈(0, 1), NeuRIPs( ¯P) is satisfied with probability at least

One should notice that, in Theorem 1, there is a tradeoff between the parameter s, which limits the
deviation | ∥· ∥m −∥· ∥µ|, and the confidence parameter u. The lower bound on the corresponding
sample size m is split into two scaling regimes when understanding the quotient u of |∥·∥m−∥·∥µ|/s
as a precision parameter. While in the regime of low deviations and high probabilities the sample size
m must scale quadratically with u/s, in the regime of less precise statements one observes a linear
scaling.

Uniform Generalization of Sublevel Sets of the Empirical Risk
When the NeuRIPs event occurs, the function norm || · ||µ, which is related to the expected risk, is
close to || · ||m, which corresponds to the empirical risk. Motivated by this property, we aim to find
a shallow ReLU network ϕ¯p with small expected risk by solving the empirical risk minimization
problem:
min
¯p∈¯
P ∥ϕ¯p −y∥2
m.
Since the set Φ ¯
P of shallow ReLU networks is non-convex, this minimization cannot be solved
with efficient convex optimizers. Therefore, instead of analyzing only the solution ϕ∗
¯p of the opti-
mization problem, we introduce a tolerance ϵ > 0 for the empirical risk and provide bounds on the
generalization error, which hold uniformly on the sublevel set
¯Qy,ϵ :=

¯p ∈¯P : ∥ϕ¯p −y∥2
m ≤ϵ
	
.
Before considering generic regression problems, we will initially assume the label y to be a neural
network itself, parameterized by a tuple p∗within the hypothesis set P. For all (x, y) in the support of
µ, we have y = ϕp∗(x) and the expected risk’s minimum on P is zero. Using the sufficient condition
for NeuRIPs from Theorem 1, we can provide generalization bounds for ϕ¯p ∈¯Qy,ϵ for any ϵ > 0.
Theorem 2. Let ¯P be a parameter set that satisfies Assumption 1 and let u ≥2 and t ≥ϵ > 0 be
constants. Furthermore, let the number m of samples satisfy
m ≥8n3c2

where C1 and C2 are universal constants. Let {(xj, yj)}m
j=1 be a dataset respecting Assumption 2
and let there exist a ¯p∗∈¯P such that yj = ϕ¯p∗(xj) holds for all j ∈[m]. Then, with probability at
least 1 −17 exp(−u/4), we have for all ¯q ∈¯Qy,ϵ that
∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥2
µ ≤t.
Proof. We notice that ¯Qy,ϵ is a set of shallow neural networks with 2n neurons. We normalize such
networks with a function norm greater than t and parameterize them by
¯Rt := {ϕ¯p −ϕ¯p∗: ¯p ∈¯P, ∥ϕ¯p −ϕ¯p∗∥µ > t}.
We assume that NeuRIPs( ¯Rt) holds for s = (t −ϵ)2/t2. In this case, for all ¯q ∈¯Qy,ϵ, we have that
∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥m ≥t and thus ¯q /∈¯Qϕ¯
p∗,ϵ, which implies that ∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥µ ≤t.
We also note that ¯Rt satisfies Assumption 1 with a rescaled constant cw/t and normalization-invariant
cb, if ¯P satisfies it for cw and cb. Theorem 1 gives a lower bound on the sample complexity for
NeuRIPs( ¯Rt), completing the proof.
At any network where an optimization method terminates, the concentration of the empirical risk
at the expected risk can be achieved with less data than needed to achieve an analogous NeuRIPs
event. However, in the chosen stochastic setting, we cannot assume that the termination of an
optimization and the norm concentration at that network are independent events. We overcome this
by not specifying the outcome of an optimization method and instead stating uniform bounds on
the norm concentration. The only assumption on an algorithm is therefore the identification of a
network that permits an upper bound ϵ on its empirical risk. The event NeuRIPs( ¯Rt) then restricts the
expected risk to be below the corresponding level t.
We now discuss the empirical risk surface for generic distributions µ that satisfy Assumption 2, where
y does not necessarily have to be a neural network.
Theorem 3. There exist constants C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 such that the following holds: Let ¯P
satisfy Assumption 1 for some constants cw, cb, and let ¯p∗∈¯P be such that for some c¯p∗≥0 we

It suffices to show, that within the stated confidence level we have ∥ϕ¯q −y∥µ > η . This implies the
claim since ∥ϕ¯q −y∥m ≤ϵ implies ∥ϕ¯q −y∥µ ≤η. We have E[E(¯q, ¯p∗)] > 0. It now only remains
to strengthen the condition on η > 3∥ϕ¯p∗−y∥µ to achieve E(¯q, ¯p∗) > ω2. We apply Theorem 1
to derive a bound on the fluctuation of the first term. The concentration rate of the second term is
derived similar to Theorem 1 by using chaining techniques. Finally in Appendix E, Theorem 12 gives
a general bound to achieve
E(¯q, ¯p∗) > ω2
uniformly for all ¯q with ∥ϕ¯q −ϕ¯p∗∥µ > η. Theorem 3 then follows as a simplification.
It is important to notice that, in Theorem 3, as the data size m approaches infinity, one can select
an asymptotically small deviation constant s. In this limit, the bound η on the generalization error
converges to 3∥ϕ¯p∗−y∥µ + ω. This reflects a lower limit of the generalization bound, which is the
sum of the theoretically achievable minimum of the expected risk and the additional tolerance ω.
The latter is an upper bound on the empirical risk, which real-world optimization algorithms can be
expected to achieve.

Size Control of Stochastic Processes on Shallow Networks
In this section, we introduce the key techniques for deriving concentration statements for the em-
pirical norm, uniformly valid for sets of shallow ReLU networks. We begin by rewriting the event
NeuRIPs( ¯P) by treating µ as a stochastic process, indexed by the parameter set ¯P. The event
NeuRIPs( ¯P) holds if and only if we have
sup
¯p∈¯
P
|∥ϕ¯p∥m −∥ϕ¯p∥µ| ≤s sup
¯p∈¯
P
∥ϕ¯p∥µ.
The supremum of stochastic processes has been studied in terms of their size. To determine the size
of a process, it is essential to determine the correlation between its variables. To this end, we define
the Sub-Gaussian metric for any parameter tuples ¯p, ¯q ∈¯P as
dψ2(ϕ¯p, ϕ¯q) := inf
(
Cψ2 ≥0 : E
""
exp
 
|ϕ¯p(x) −ϕ¯q(x)|2
C2
ψ2
!#

)
.
A small Sub-Gaussian metric between random variables indicates that their values are likely to be
close. To capture the Sub-Gaussian structure of a process, we introduce ϵ-nets in the Sub-Gaussian
metric. For a given ϵ > 0, these are subsets ¯Q ⊆¯P such that for every ¯p ∈¯P, there is a ¯q ∈¯Q
satisfying
dψ2(ϕ¯p, ϕ¯q) ≤ϵ.
The smallest cardinality of such an ϵ-net ¯Q is known as the Sub-Gaussian covering number
N(Φ ¯
P , dψ2, ϵ). The next Lemma offers a bound for such covering numbers specific to shallow
ReLU networks.

The proof of this Lemma is based on the theory of stochastic processes and can be seen in Theorem 8
of Appendix C.
To obtain bounds of the form (6) on the size of a process, we use the generic chaining method. This
method offers bounds in terms of the Talagrand-functional of the process in the Sub-Gaussian metric.
We define it as follows. A sequence T = (Tk)k∈N0 in a set T is admissible if T0 = 1 and Tk ≤2(2k).
The Talagrand-functional of the metric space is then defined as
γ2(T, d) := inf
(Tk) sup

With the bounds on the Sub-Gaussian covering number from Lemma 1, we provide a bound on the

be of independent interest.

Uniform Generalization of Sublevel Sets of the Empirical Risk
In case of the NeuRIPs event, the function norm || · ||µ corresponding to the expected risk is close
to || · ||m, which corresponds to the empirical risk. With the previous results, we can now derive

Conclusion
In this study, we investigated the empirical risk surface of shallow ReLU networks in terms of uniform
concentration events for the empirical norm. We defined the Neural Restricted Isometry Property
(NeuRIPs) and determined the sample complexity required to achieve NeuRIPs, which depends on
realistic parameter bounds and the network architecture. We applied our findings to derive upper
bounds on the expected risk, which are valid uniformly across sublevel sets of the empirical risk.
If a network optimization algorithm can identify a network with a small empirical risk, our results
guarantee that this network will generalize well. By deriving uniform concentration statements, we
have resolved the problem of independence between the termination of an optimization algorithm at
a certain network and the empirical risk concentration at that network. Future studies may focus on
performing uniform empirical norm concentration on the critical points of the empirical risk, which
could lead to even tighter bounds for the sample complexity.
We also plan to apply our methods to input distributions more general than the Gaussian distribution.
If generic Gaussian distributions can be handled, one could then derive bounds for the Sub-Gaussian
covering number for deep ReLU networks by induction across layers. We also expect that our
results on the covering numbers could be extended to more generic Lipschitz continuous activation
functions other than ReLU. This proposition is based on the concentration of measure phenomenon,
which provides bounds on the Sub-Gaussian norm of functions on normal concentrating input spaces.
Because these bounds scale with the Lipschitz constant of the function, they can be used to find ϵ-nets
for neurons that have identical activation patterns.
Broader Impact
Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is
critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.
We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration
events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.

R014.pdf,"Addressing Min-Max Challenges in Nonconvex-Nonconcave Problems
with Solutions Exhibiting Weak Minty Properties
Abstract
This research examines a specific category of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems that demon-
strate a characteristic known as weak Minty solutions. This concept, which has only recently been defined, has
already demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time.
We establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) within
this framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squared
operator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG). Furthermore, we introduce a modified
version of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem’s
specific parameters.
1
Introduction
The recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,
have generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,
adversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed
that generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization
component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in
certain cases.
A specific subset of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was analyzed, and it was found that the extragradient method (EG)
exhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings. Surprisingly, these problems did not appear to possess any of
the recognized favorable characteristics, such as monotonicity or Minty solutions. Subsequently, a suitable concept was identified
(see Assumption 1), which is less restrictive than the presence of a Minty solution (a condition frequently employed in the existing
literature) and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity. Because of these properties that unify and generalize, the concept of
weak Minty solutions was quickly investigated.
Assumption 1 (Weak Minty solution). For a given operator F : Rd →Rd, there is a point u∗∈Rd and a parameter ρ > 0 such that:
⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥−ρ
2∥F(u)∥2
∀u ∈Rd.
(1)
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that a modified version of EG is capable of addressing problems with such solutions, achieving
a complexity of O(ϵ−1) for the squared operator norm. This adaptation, referred to as EG+, is based on a bold extrapolation step
followed by a cautious update step. A similar step size approach has been previously examined in the context of a stochastic variant
of EG.
In a similar vein, we explore a variation of the optimistic gradient descent ascent (OGDA), also known as Forward-Reflected-
Backward (FoRB). We address the following question with an affirmative answer:
Can OGDA achieve convergence guarantees comparable to those of EG when dealing with weak Minty solutions?
Specifically, we demonstrate that a modified version of the OGDA method, defined for a step size a > 0 and a parameter 0 < γ ≤1
as follows:
uk = ¯uk −aF(¯uk),
¯uk+1 = ¯uk −γaF(uk),
∀k ≥0,
can achieve the same convergence bounds as EG+ by requiring only a single gradient oracle call in each iteration.
It is worth noting that OGDA is most frequently expressed in a form where γ = 1. However, two recent studies have examined
a more generalized coefficient. While these earlier studies focused on the monotone setting, the true significance of γ becomes
apparent only when dealing with weak Minty solutions. In this context, we find that γ must be greater than 1 to ensure convergence,
a phenomenon that is not observed in monotone problems.
When examining a general smooth min-max problem:
min
x max
y
f(x, y)
the operator F mentioned in Assumption 1 naturally emerges as F(u) := [∇xf(x, y), −∇yf(x, y)] with u = (x, y). However,
by examining saddle point problems from the broader viewpoint of variational inequalities (VIs) through the operator F, we can
concurrently address more scenarios, such as certain equilibrium problems.
The parameter ρ in the definition of weak Minty solutions (1) is crucial for both the analysis and the experiments. Specifically, it
is essential that the step size exceeds a value proportional to ρ. Simultaneously, as is typical, the step size is limited from above
by the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of F. For instance, since some researchers require the step size to be less than
1
4L, their
convergence claim is valid only if ρ <
1
4L. This condition was later improved to ρ <
1
2L for the choice γ = 1 and to ρ < 1
L for
even smaller values of γ. As in the monotone setting, OGDA requires a smaller step size than EG. Nevertheless, through a different
analysis, we are able to match the most general condition on the weak Minty parameter ρ < 1
L for appropriate γ and a.
1.1
Contribution
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1. We establish a new convergence rate of O(1/k), measured by the squared operator norm, for a modified version of OGDA,
which we call OGDA+. This rate matches that of EG and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to
the Minty variational inequality.
2. Even when a stronger condition is imposed, specifically that the operator is also monotone, we enhance the range of feasible
step sizes for OGDA+ and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method (γ = 1).
3. We demonstrate a complexity bound of O(ϵ−2) for a stochastic variant of the OGDA+ method.
4. We also introduce an adaptive step size version of EG+. This version achieves the same convergence guarantees without
requiring any knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator F. Consequently, it can potentially take larger steps in
areas with low curvature, enabling convergence where a fixed step size strategy might fail.
1.2
Related literature
We will concentrate on the nonconvex-nonconcave setting, as there is a substantial body of work on convergence rates in terms of a gap
function or distance to a solution for monotone problems, as well as generalizations such as nonconvex-concave, convex-nonconcave,
or under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz assumption.
Weak Minty. It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,
termed ""weak Minty,"" without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.
Convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as
the update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the
length of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is
also proposed, which may incur extra gradient computations or require second-order information (in contrast to the adaptive step
size we propose in Algorithm 3). A different approach is taken by focusing on the min-max setting and using multiple ascent steps
per descent step, achieving the same O(1/k) rate as EG.
Minty solutions. Numerous studies have presented various methods for scenarios where the problem at hand has a Minty solution.
It was shown that weakly monotone VIs can be solved by iteratively adding a quadratic proximity term and repeatedly optimizing
the resulting strongly monotone VI using any convergent method. The convergence of the OGDA method was proven, but without a
specific rate. It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. While
the assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotone
problems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any point
by a factor proportional to the squared operator norm.
Negative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term ""cohypomonotonicity,"" the concept of negative comono-
tonicity has recently been explored. It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty
solutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and
an improved convergence rate of O(1/k2) (in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of
the reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty
solutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty
solution). Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradient
norm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiate
this class from problems with weak Minty solutions.
2
Interaction dominance. The concept of α-interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated,
and it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in y and linearly if it is met in both
components. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negatively
comonotone.
Optimism. The positive effects of introducing the simple modification commonly known as optimism have recently attracted the
attention of the machine learning community. Its name comes from online optimization. The idea dates back even further and has
also been studied in the mathematical programming community.

Preliminaries
2.1
Notions of solution
We outline the most frequently used solution concepts in the context of variational inequalities (VIs) and related areas. These
concepts are typically defined with respect to a constraint set C ⊆Rd. A Stampacchia solution of the VI given by F : Rd →Rd is a
point u∗such that:
⟨F(u∗), u −u∗⟩≥0
∀u ∈C.
(SVI)
In this work, we only consider the unconstrained case where C = Rd, and the above condition simplifies to F(u∗) = 0. Closely
related is the following concept: A Minty solution is a point u∗∈C such that:
⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥0
∀u ∈C.
(MVI)
For a continuous operator F, a Minty solution of the VI is always a Stampacchia solution. The converse is generally not true but
holds, for example, if the operator F is monotone. Specifically, there are nonmonotone problems with Stampacchia solutions but
without any Minty solutions.
2.2
Notions of monotonicity
This section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them.
An operator F is considered monotone if:
⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥0.
Such operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions, from convex-concave min-max problems, or from equilibrium
problems.
Two frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators, which satisfy:
⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥µ∥u −v∥2,
and cocoercive operators, which fulfill:
⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥β∥F(u) −F(v)∥2.
(2)
Strongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in strongly-convex-strongly-concave min-max
problems. Cocoercive operators appear, for instance, as gradients of smooth convex functions, in which case (2) holds with β equal
to the inverse of the gradient’s Lipschitz constant.
Departing from monotonicity. Both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring
the non-monotone domain. Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles and
spurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First and
foremost is the extensively studied setting of ν-weak monotonicity:
⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥−ν∥u −v∥2.
Such operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as it
includes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this
property. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,
has received much less attention and is given by:
⟨F(u) −F(v), u −v⟩≥−γ∥F(u) −F(v)∥2.
Clearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.
Behavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient
to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of
monotonicity, it is enough to ask for the operator F to be star-monotone, i.e.,
⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥0,
or star-cocoercive,
⟨F(u), u −u∗⟩≥γ∥F(u)∥2.
In this spirit, we can provide a new interpretation to the assumption of the existence of a weak Minty solution as asking for the
operator F to be negatively star-cocoercive (with respect to at least one solution). Furthermore, we want to point out that while the
above star notions are sometimes required to hold for all solutions u∗, in the following we only require it to hold for a single solution.

OGDA for problems with weak Minty solutions
The generalized version of OGDA, which we denote with a ""+"" to emphasize the presence of the additional parameter γ, is given by:
Algorithm 1 OGDA+
Require: Starting point u0 = u−1 ∈Rd, step size a > 0 and parameter 0 < γ < 1.
for k = 0, 1, ... do
uk+1 = uk −a((1 + γ)F(uk) −F(uk−1))
end for
Theorem 3.1. Let F : Rd →Rd be L-Lipschitz continuous satisfying Assumption 1 with 1
L > ρ, and let (uk)k≥0 be the iterates
generated by Algorithm 1 with step size a satisfying a > ρ and
aL ≤1 −γ
1 + γ .
(3)
Then, for all k ≥0,
min
i=0,...,k−1 ∥F(ui)∥2 ≤
1
kaγ(a −ρ)∥u0 + aF(u0) −u∗∥2.
In particular, as long as ρ < 1
L, we can find a γ small enough such that the above bound holds.
The first observation is that we would like to choose a as large as possible, as this allows us to treat the largest class of problems
with ρ < a. To be able to choose a large step size a, we must decrease γ, as evident from (3). However, this degrades the algorithm’s
speed by making the update steps smaller. The same effect can be observed for EG+ and is therefore not surprising. One could
derive an optimal γ (i.e., minimizing the right-hand side) from Theorem 3.1, but this results in a non-intuitive cubic dependence on
ρ. In practice, the strategy of decreasing γ until convergence is achieved, but not further, yields reasonable results.
Furthermore, we want to point out that the condition ρ < 1
L is precisely the best possible bound for EG+.
3.1
Improved bounds under monotonicity
While the above theorem also holds if the operator F is monotone, we can modify the proof slightly to obtain a better dependence on
the parameters:
Theorem 3.2. Let F : Rd →Rd be monotone and L-Lipschitz. If aL = 2−γ
2+γ −ϵ for ϵ > 0, then the iterates generated by OGDA+
fulfill
min
i=0,...,k−1 ∥F(ui)∥2 ≤
2
ka2γ2ϵ∥u0 + aF(u0) −u∗∥2.
In particular, we can choose γ = 1 and a <
1
2L.
There are different works discussing the convergence of OGDA in terms of the iterates or a gap function with a <
1
2L. However, we
want to compare the above bound to more similar results on rates for the best iterate in terms of the operator norm. The same rate as
ours for OGDA is shown, but requires the conservative step size bound a ≤
1
16L. This was later improved to a ≤
1
3L. All of these
only deal with the case γ = 1. The only other reference that deals with a generalized (i.e., not necessarily γ = 1) version of OGDA
is another work, where the resulting step size condition is a ≤2−γ
4L , which is strictly worse than ours for any γ. To summarize, not
only do we show for the first time that the step size of a generalization of OGDA can go above
1
2L, but we also provide the least
restrictive bound for any value of γ.
3.2
OGDA+ stochastic
In this section, we discuss the setting where, instead of the exact operator F, we only have access to a collection of independent
estimators F(·, ξi) at every iteration. We assume here that the estimator F is unbiased, i.e., E[F(uk, ξ)|uk−1] = F(uk), and has
bounded variance E[∥F(uk, ξ) −F(uk)∥2] ≤σ2. We show that we can still guarantee convergence by using batch sizes B of order
O(ϵ−1).
Algorithm 2 stochastic OGDA+

Theorem 3.3. Let F : Rd →Rd be L-Lipschitz satisfying Assumption 1 with 1
L > ρ, and let (uk)k≥0 be the sequence of
iterates generated by stochastic OGDA+, with a and γ satisfying ρ < a < 1−γ
1+γ

L. Then, to visit an ϵ-stationary point such that
mini=0,...,k−1 E[∥F(ui)∥2] < ϵ, we require

calls to the stochastic oracle ˜F, with large batch sizes of order O(ϵ−1).
In practice, large batch sizes of order O(ϵ−1) are typically not desirable; instead, a small or decreasing step size is preferred. In the
weak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately,
the current analysis does not allow for variable γ.
4
EG+ with adaptive step sizes
In this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the
Lipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to
small step sizes and slow convergence behavior. However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest in
choosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the
step size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter ρ to guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we want
to outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carried
out.
Since the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptive
step size which estimates the inverse of the (local) Lipschitz constant, see (4). Due to the fact that the literature on adaptive methods,
especially in the context of VIs, is so vast, we do not aim to give a comprehensive review but highlight only a few with especially
interesting properties. In particular, we do not want to touch on methods with a linesearch procedure, which typically result in
multiple gradient computations per iteration.
We use a simple and therefore widely used step size choice that naively estimates the local Lipschitz constant and forces a monotone
decreasing behavior. Such step sizes have been used extensively for monotone VIs and similarly in the context of the mirror-prox
method, which corresponds to EG in the setting of (non-Euclidean) Bregman distances.
A version of EG with a different adaptive step size choice has been investigated, with the unique feature that it is able to achieve the
optimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems without modification. However, these rates are only for monotone VIs and
are in terms of the gap function.
One of the drawbacks of adaptive methods resides in the fact that the step sizes are typically required to be nonincreasing, which
results in poor behavior if a high-curvature area was visited by the iterates before reaching a low-curvature region. To the best of our
knowledge, the only method that is allowed to use nonmonotone step sizes to treat VIs and does not use a possibly costly linesearch
is the golden ratio algorithm. It comes with the additional benefit of not requiring a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of F at
all. While it is known that this method converges under the stronger assumption of the existence of Minty solutions, a quantitative
convergence result is still open.
Algorithm 3 EG+ with adaptive step size
Require: Starting points u0, ¯u0 ∈Rd, initial step size a0 and parameters τ ∈(0, 1) and 0 < γ ≤1.
for k = 0, 1, ... do
Find the step size:
ak = min


(4)
Compute next iterate:
uk = ¯uk −akF(¯uk)
¯uk+1 = ¯uk −akγF(uk).
end for
Clearly, ak is monotonically decreasing by construction. Moreover, it is bounded away from zero by the simple observation that
ak ≥min{a0, τ/L} > 0. The sequence therefore converges to a positive number, which we denote by a∞:= limk ak.
Theorem 4.1. Let F : Rd →Rd be L-Lipschitz that satisfies Assumption 1, where u∗denotes any weak Minty solution, with
a∞> 2ρ, and let (uk)k≥0 be the iterates generated by Algorithm 3 with γ = 1
2 and τ ∈(0, 1). Then, there exists a k0 ∈N such that
min
i=k0,...,k ∥F(uk)∥2 ≤
1
k −k0
L
τ(a∞/2 −ρ)∥¯uk0 −u∗∥2.
5
Algorithm 3 presented above provides several benefits but also some drawbacks. The main advantage resides in the fact that the
Lipschitz constant of the operator F does not need to be known. Moreover, the step size choice presented in (4) might allow us
to take steps much larger than what would be suggested by a global Lipschitz constant if the iterates never, or only during later
iterations, visit the region of high curvature (large local L). In such cases, these larger step sizes come with the additional advantage
that they allow us to solve a richer class of problems, as we are able to relax the condition ρ <
1
4L in the case of EG+ to ρ < a∞/2,
where a∞= limk ak ≥τ/L.
On the other hand, we face the problem that the bounds in Theorem 4.1 only hold after an unknown number of initial iterations when
ak/ak+1 ≤1
τ is finally satisfied. In theory, this might take a long time if the curvature around the solution is much higher than in
the starting area, as this will force the need to decrease the step size very late into the solution process, resulting in the quotient
ak/ak+1 being too large. This drawback could be mitigated by choosing τ smaller. However, this will result in poor performance
due to small step sizes. Even for monotone problems where this type of step size has been proposed, this problem could not be
circumvented, and authors instead focused on the convergence of the iterates without any rate.

Numerical experiments
In the following, we compare the EG+ method with the two methods we propose: OGDA+ and EG+ with adaptive step size (see
Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3, respectively). Last but not least, we also include the CurvatureEG+ method, which is a modification
of EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed with
an initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments.
5.1
Von Neumann’s ratio game
We consider von Neumann’s ratio game, which is given by:
min
x∈∆m max
y∈∆n V (x, y) = ⟨x, Ry⟩
⟨x, Sy⟩,
(5)
where R ∈Rm×n and S ∈Rm×n with ⟨x, Sy⟩> 0 for all x ∈∆m, y ∈∆n, with ∆:= {z ∈Rd : zi > 0, Pd
i=1 zi = 1} denoting
the unit simplex. Expression (5) can be interpreted as the value V (x, y) for a stochastic game with a single state and mixed strategies.
We see an illustration of a particularly difficult instance of (5). Interestingly, we still observe good convergence behavior, although
an estimated ρ is more than ten times larger than the estimated Lipschitz constant.
5.2
Forsaken
A particularly difficult min-max toy example with a ""Forsaken"" solution was proposed and is given by:
min
x∈R max
y∈R x(y −0.45) + ϕ(x) −ϕ(y),
(6)
where ϕ(z) = 1
6z6 −2
4z4 + 1
4z2 −1
2z. This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at (x∗, y∗) ≈(0.08, 0.4), but also two limit
cycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to
the solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus ""shielding"" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box
∥(x, y)∥∞< 3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with ρ ≥2 · 0.477761, which is much larger than
1
2L ≈0.08. In line
with these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by 1
L converge. In light of this
observation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz
constant. Similarly, our proposed adaptive step size version of EG+ (see Algorithm 3) is also able to break through the repelling
limit cycle and converge to the solution. On top of this, it does so at a faster rate and without the need for additional computations in
the backtracking procedure.
5.3
Lower bound example
The following min-max problem was introduced as a lower bound on the dependence between ρ and L for EG+:
min
x∈R max
y∈R µxy + ζ
2(x2 −y2).
(7)
In particular, it was stated that EG+ (with any γ) and constant step size a = 1
L converges for this problem if and only if (0, 0) is a
weak Minty solution with ρ < 1−γ
L , where ρ and L can be computed explicitly in the above example and are given by:
L =
p
µ2 + ζ2
and
ρ = µ2 −ζ2
2µ
.
By choosing µ = 3 and ζ = −1, we get exactly ρ = 1
L, therefore predicting divergence of EG+ for any γ, which is exactly what is
empirically observed. Although the general upper bound proved in Theorem 3.1 only states convergence in the case ρ < 1
L, we
observe rapid convergence of OGDA+ for this example, showcasing that it can drastically outperform EG+ in some scenarios.

Conclusion
Many intriguing questions persist in the domain of min-max problems, particularly when departing from the convex-concave
framework. Very recently, it was demonstrated that the O(1/k) bounds on the squared operator norm for EG and OGDA for the
last iterate (and not just the best one) are valid even in the negatively comonotone setting. Deriving a comparable statement in the
presence of merely weak Minty solutions remains an open question.
In general, our analysis and experiments seem to suggest that there is minimal benefit in employing OGDA+ over EG+ for the
majority of problems, as the reduced iteration cost is counterbalanced by the smaller step size. An exception is presented by problem
(7), which is not covered by theory, and OGDA+ is the only method capable of converging.
Finally, we note that the previous paradigm in pure minimization of ""smaller step size ensures convergence"" but ""larger step size
gets there faster,"" where the latter is typically constrained by the reciprocal of the gradient’s Lipschitz constant, does not appear
to hold true for min-max problems anymore. The analysis of various methods in the presence of weak Minty solutions indicates
that convergence can be lost if the step size is excessively small and sometimes needs to be larger than 1
L, which one can typically
only hope for in adaptive methods. Our EG+ method with adaptive step size accomplishes this even without the added expense of a

R015.pdf,"Examining the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Models: A Quantitative Analysis
Abstract
Deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, are a significant family within deep learning. This study
provides a precise upper limit for the Wasserstein distance between a learned distribution by a diffusion model
and the target distribution. In contrast to earlier research, this analysis does not rely on presumptions regarding
the learned score function. Furthermore, the findings are applicable to any data-generating distributions within
restricted instance spaces, even those lacking a density relative to the Lebesgue measure, and the upper limit is not
exponentially dependent on the ambient space dimension. The primary finding expands upon recent research by
Mbacke et al. (2023), and the proofs presented are fundamental.
1
Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (VAEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples. Conversely, SGMs
employ score-matching methods to approximate the score function of the data-generating distribution, subsequently generating new
samples through Langevin dynamics. Recognizing that real-world distributions might lack a defined score function, adding varying
noise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the score
function for all noise levels has been proposed.
Although DDPMs and SGMs may initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs implicitly approximate the score
function, with the sampling process resembling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, a unified perspective of both methods using stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) has been derived. The SGM can be viewed as a discretization of Brownian motion, and the DDPM as a
discretization of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Consequently, both DDPMs and SGMs are commonly referred to as SGMs in the
literature. This explains why prior research investigating the theoretical aspects of diffusion models has adopted the score-based
framework, necessitating assumptions about the effectiveness of the learned score function.
In this research, a different strategy is employed, applying methods created for VAEs to DDPMs, which can be viewed as hierarchical
VAEs with fixed encoders. This method enables the derivation of quantitative, Wasserstein-based upper bounds without making
assumptions about the data distribution or the learned score function, and with simple proofs that do not need the SDE toolkit.
Furthermore, the bounds presented here do not involve any complex discretization steps, as the forward and backward processes are
considered discrete-time from the beginning, rather than being viewed as discretizations of continuous-time processes.
1.1
Related Works
There has been an increasing amount of research aimed at providing theoretical findings on the convergence of SGMs. However,
these studies frequently depend on restrictive assumptions regarding the data-generating distribution, produce non-quantitative upper
bounds, or exhibit exponential dependencies on certain parameters. This work successfully circumvents all three of these limitations.
Some bounds are based on very restrictive assumptions about the data-generating distribution, such as log-Sobolev inequalities,
which are unrealistic for real-world data distributions. Furthermore, some studies establish upper bounds on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence or the total variation (TV) distance between the data-generating distribution and the distribution learned by the
diffusion model; however, unless strong assumptions are made about the support of the data-generating distribution, KL and TV
reach their maximum values. Such assumptions arguably do not hold for real-world data-generating distributions, which are widely
believed to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Other work establishes conditions under which the support of the input distribution
is equal to the support of the learned distribution, and generalizes the bound to all f-divergences. Assuming L2 accurate score
estimation, some establish Wasserstein distance upper bounds under weaker assumptions on the data-generating distribution, but
their Wasserstein-based bounds are not quantitative. Quantitative Wasserstein distance upper bounds under the manifold hypothesis
have been derived, but these bounds exhibit exponential dependencies on some of the problem parameters.
1.2
Our contributions
In this study, strong assumptions about the data-generating distribution are avoided, and a quantitative upper bound on the Wasserstein
distance is established without exponential dependencies on problem parameters, including the ambient space dimension. Moreover,
a common aspect of the aforementioned studies is that their bounds are contingent on the error of the score estimator. According to
some, providing precise guarantees for the estimation of the score function is challenging, as it necessitates an understanding of the
non-convex training dynamics of neural network optimization, which is currently beyond reach. Therefore, upper bounds are derived
without making assumptions about the learned score function. Instead, the bound presented here is dependent on a reconstruction
loss calculated over a finite independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample. Intuitively, a loss function is defined, which
quantifies the average Euclidean distance between a sample from the data-generating distribution and the reconstruction obtained by
sampling noise and passing it through the backward process (parameterized by ˘03b8). This method is inspired by previous work on
VAEs.
This approach offers numerous benefits: it does not impose restrictive assumptions on the data-generating distribution, avoids
exponential dependencies on the dimension, and provides a quantitative upper bound based on the Wasserstein distance. Furthermore,
this method benefits from utilizing very straightforward and basic proofs.

Preliminaries
Throughout this paper, lowercase letters are used to represent both probability measures and their densities with respect to the
Lebesgue measure, and variables are added in parentheses to enhance readability (e.g., q(xt|xt−1) to denote a time-dependent
conditional distribution). An instance space X, which is a subset of RD with the Euclidean distance as the underlying metric, and
a target data-generating distribution µ ∈M +
1 (X) are considered. Note that it is not assumed that µ has a density with respect to
the Lebesgue measure. Additionally, || · || represents the Euclidean (L2) norm, and Ep(x) is used as shorthand for Ex∼p(x). Given
probability measures p, q ∈M +
1 (X) and a real number k > 1, the Wasserstein distance of order k is defined as (Villani, 2009):
Wk(p, q) =
inf
γ∈Γ(p,q)
Z
X×X
||x −y||kdγ(x, y)
1/k
,
where Γ(p, q) denotes the set of couplings of p and q, meaning the set of joint distributions on X × X with respective marginals p
and q. The product measure p ⊗q is referred to as the trivial coupling, and the Wasserstein distance of order 1 is simply referred to
as the Wasserstein distance.
2.1
Denoising Diffusion Models
Instead of employing the SDE framework, diffusion models are presented using the DDPM formulation with discrete-time processes.
A diffusion model consists of two discrete-time stochastic processes: a forward process and a backward process. Both processes are
indexed by time 0 ≤t ≤T, where the number of time steps T is a predetermined choice.
**The forward process.** The forward process transforms a data point x0 ∼µ into a noise distribution q(xT |x0) through a sequence
of conditional distributions q(xt|xt−1) for 1 ≤t ≤T. It is assumed that the forward process is defined such that for sufficiently
large T, the distribution q(xT |x0) is close to a simple noise distribution p(xT ), which is referred to as the prior distribution. For
instance, p(xT ) = N(xT ; 0, I), the standard multivariate normal distribution, has been chosen in previous work.
**The backward process.** The backward process is a Markov process with parametric transition kernels. The objective of the
backward process is to perform the reverse operation of the forward process: transforming noise samples into (approximate) samples
from the distribution µ. Following previous work, it is assumed that the backward process is defined by Gaussian distributions
pθ(xt−1|xt) for 2 ≤t ≤T as
pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; gθ
t (xt), σ2
t I),
and
pθ(x0|x1) = gθ
1(x1),
where the variance parameters σ2
t ∈R≥0 are defined by a fixed schedule, the mean functions gθ
t : RD →RD are learned using a
neural network (with parameters θ) for 2 ≤t ≤T, and gθ
1 : RD →X is a separate function dependent on σ1. In practice, the same
network has been used for the functions gθ
t for 2 ≤t ≤T, and a separate discrete decoder for gθ
1.
2
Generating new samples from a trained diffusion model is accomplished by sampling xt−1 ∼pθ(xt−1|xt) for 1 ≤t ≤T, starting
from a noise vector xT ∼p(xT ) sampled from the prior p(xT ).
The following assumption is made regarding the backward process.
**Assumption 1.** It is assumed that for each 1 ≤t ≤T, there exists a constant Kθ
t > 0 such that for every x1, x2 ∈X,
||gθ
t (x1) −gθ
t (x2)|| ≤Kθ
t ||x1 −x2||.
In other words, gθ
t is Kθ
t -Lipschitz continuous. This assumption is discussed in Remark 3.2.
2.2
Additional Definitions
The distribution πθ(·|x0) is defined as
πθ(·|x0) = q(xT |x0)pθ(xT −1|xT )pθ(xT −2|xT −1) . . . pθ(x1|x2)pθ(·|x1).
Intuitively, for each x0 ∈X, πθ(·|x0) represents the distribution on X obtained by reconstructing samples from q(xT |x0) through
the backward process. Another way to interpret this distribution is that for any function f : X →R, the following equation holds:
Eπθ(ˆx0|x0)[f(ˆx0)] = Eq(xT |x0)Epθ(xT −1|xT ) . . . Epθ(x1|x2)Epθ(ˆx0|x1)[f(ˆx0)].
Given a finite set S = {x1
0, . . . , xn
0} i.i.d. ∼µ, the regenerated distribution is defined as the following mixture:
µθ
n = 1
n
n
X
i=1
πθ(·|xi
0).
This definition is analogous to the empirical regenerated distribution defined for VAEs. The distribution on X learned by the
diffusion model is denoted as πθ(·) and defined as
πθ(·) = p(xT )pθ(xT −1|xT )pθ(xT −2|xT −1) . . . pθ(x1|x2)pθ(·|x1).
In other words, for any function f : X →R, the expectation of f with respect to πθ(·) is
Eπθ(ˆx0)[f(ˆx0)] = Ep(xT )Epθ(xT −1|xT ) . . . Epθ(x1|x2)Epθ(ˆx0|x1)[f(ˆx0)].
Hence, both πθ(·) and πθ(·|x0) are defined using the backward process, with the difference that πθ(·) starts with the prior
p(xT ) = N(xT ; 0, I), while πθ(·|x0) starts with the noise distribution q(xT |x0).
Finally, the loss function lθ : X × X →R is defined as
lθ(xT , x0) = Epθ(xT −1|xT )Epθ(xT −2|xT −1) . . . Epθ(x1|x2)Epθ(ˆx0|x1)[||x0 −ˆx0||].
Hence, given a noise vector xT and a sample x0, the loss lθ(xT , x0) represents the average Euclidean distance between x0 and any
sample obtained by passing xT through the backward process.
2.3
Our Approach
The goal is to upper-bound the distance W1(µ, πθ(·)). Since the triangle inequality implies
W1(µ, πθ(·)) ≤W1(µ, µθ
n) + W1(µθ
n, πθ(·)),
the distance W1(µ, πθ(·)) can be upper-bounded by upper-bounding the two expressions on the right-hand side separately. The
upper bound on W1(µ, µθ
n) is obtained using a straightforward adaptation of a proof. First, W1(µ, µθ
n) is upper-bounded using the
expectation of the loss function lθ, then the resulting expression is upper-bounded using a PAC-Bayesian-style expression dependent
on the empirical risk and the prior-matching term.
The upper bound on the second term W1(µθ
n, πθ(·)) uses the definition of µθ
n. Intuitively, the difference between πθ(·|xi
0) and πθ(·)
is determined by the corresponding initial distributions: q(xT |xi
0) and p(xT ) for πθ(·). Hence, if the two initial distributions are
close, and if the steps of the backward process are smooth (see Assumption 1), then πθ(·|xi
0) and πθ(·) are close to each other.

Main Result
3.1
Theorem Statement
We are now ready to present the main result: a quantitative upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the data-generating
distribution µ and the learned distribution πθ(·).
**Theorem 3.1.** Assume the instance space X has finite diameter ∆= supx,x′∈X ||x −x′|| < ∞, and let λ > 0 and δ ∈(0, 1) be
real numbers. Using the definitions and assumptions of the previous section, the following inequality holds with probability at least

**Remark 3.1.** Before presenting the proof, let us discuss Theorem 3.1.
* Because the right-hand side of the equation depends on a quantity computed using a finite i.i.d. sample S, the bound holds with
high probability with respect to the randomness of S. This is the price we pay for having a quantitative upper bound with no
exponential dependencies on problem parameters and no assumptions on the data-generating distribution µ. * The first term of the
right-hand side is the average reconstruction loss computed over the sample S = {x1
0, . . . , xn
0}. Note that for each 1 ≤i ≤n, the
expectation of lθ(xT |xi
0) is only computed with respect to the noise distribution q(xT |xi
0) defined by xi
0 itself. Hence, this term
measures how well a noise vector xT ∼q(xT |xi
0) recovers the original sample xi
0 using the backward process, and averages over
the set S = {x1
0, . . . , xn
0}. * If the Lipschitz constants satisfy Kθ
t < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T, then the larger T is, the smaller the upper
bound gets. This is because the product of Kθ
t ’s then converges to 0. In Remark 3.2 below, we show that the assumption that Kθ
t < 1
for all t is a quite reasonable one. * The hyperparameter λ controls the trade-off between the prior-matching (KL) term and the
diameter term ∆2. If Kθ
t < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T and T →∞, then the convergence of the bound largely depends on the choice of λ.
In that case, λ ∝n1/2 leads to faster convergence, while λ ∝n leads to slower convergence to a smaller quantity. This is because
the bound stems from PAC-Bayesian theory, where this trade-off is common. * The last term of the equation does not depend on the
sample size n. Hence, the upper bound given by Theorem 3.1 does not converge to 0 as n →∞. However, if the Lipschitz factors
(Kθ
t )1≤t≤T are all less than 1, then this term can be very small, especially in low-dimensional spaces.
3.2
Proof of the main theorem
The following result is an adaptation of a previous result.
**Lemma 3.2.** Let λ > 0 and δ ∈(0, 1) be real numbers. With probability at least 1 −δ over the randomness of the sample
S = {x1
0, . . . , xn
0} i.i.d. ∼µ, the following holds:
W1(µ, µθ

The proof of this result is a straightforward adaptation of a previous proof.
Now, let us focus our attention on the second term of the right-hand side of the equation, namely W1(µθ
n, πθ(·)). This part is trickier
than for VAEs, for which the generative model’s distribution is simply a pushforward measure. Here, we have a non-deterministic
sampling process with T steps.
Assumption 1 leads to the following lemma on the backward process.
**Lemma 3.3.** For any given x1, y1 ∈X, we have
Epθ(x0|x1)Epθ(y0|y1)[||x0 −y0||] ≤Kθ
1||x1 −y1||.
Moreover, if 2 ≤t ≤T, then for any given xt, yt ∈X, we have
4
Epθ(xt−1|xt)Epθ(yt−1|yt)[||xt−1 −yt−1||] ≤Kθ
t ||xt −yt|| + σtEϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||],
where ϵ, ϵ′ ∼N(0, I), meaning Eϵ,ϵ′ is a shorthand for Eϵ,ϵ′∼N(0,I).
**Proof.** For the first part, let x1, y1 ∈X. Since according to the equation pθ(x0|x1) = δgθ
1(x1)(x0) and pθ(y0|y1) = δgθ
1(y1)(y0),
then
Epθ(x0|x1)Epθ(y0|y1)[||x0 −y0||] = ||gθ
1(x1) −gθ
1(y1)|| ≤Kθ
1||x1 −y1||.
For the second part, let 2 ≤t ≤T and xt, yt ∈X. Since pθ(xt−1|xt) = N(xt−1; gθ
t (xt), σ2
t I), the reparameterization trick implies
that sampling xt−1 ∼pθ(xt−1|xt) is equivalent to setting
xt−1 = gθ
t (xt) + σtϵt, with ϵt ∼N(0, I).
Using the above equation, the triangle inequality, and Assumption 1, we obtain
Epθ(xt−1|xt)Epθ(yt−1|yt)[||xt−1 −yt−1||]
= Eϵt,ϵ′
t∼N(0,I)[||gθ
t (xt) + σtϵt −gθ

t||]
≤Kθ
t ||xt −yt|| + σtEϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||],
where ϵ, ϵ′ ∼N(0, I).
Next, we can use the inequalities of Lemma 3.3 to prove the following result.
**Lemma 3.4.** Let T ≥1. The following inequality holds:
Epθ(xT −1|xT )Epθ(yT −1|yT )Epθ(xT −2|xT −1)Epθ(yT −2|yT −1) . . . Epθ(x0|x1)Epθ(y0|y1)[||x0 −y0||]

**Proof Idea.** Lemma 3.4 is proven by induction using Lemma 3.3 in the induction step.
Using the two previous lemmas, we obtain the following upper bound on W1(µθ
n, πθ(·)).
**Lemma 3.5.** The following inequality holds:

**Proof.** Using the definition of W1, the trivial coupling, the definitions of µθ
n and πθ(·), and Lemma 3.4, we get the desired result.
Combining Lemmas 3.2 and 3.5 with the triangle inequality yields Theorem 3.1.
3.3
Special case using the forward process of Ho et al. (2020)
Theorem 3.1 establishes a general upper bound that holds for any forward process, as long as the backward process satisfies
Assumption 1. In this section, we specialize the statement of the theorem to the particular case of the forward process defined in
previous work.
Let X ⊆RD. The forward process is a Gauss-Markov process with transition densities defined as
q(xt|xt−1) = N(xt; √αtxt−1, (1 −αt)I),
where α1, . . . , αT is a fixed noise schedule such that 0 < αt < 1 for all t. This definition implies that at each time step 1 ≤t ≤T,
5
q(xt|x0) = N(xt; √¯αtx0, (1 −¯αt)I), with ¯αt =
tY
i=1
αi.
The optimization objective to train the backward process ensures that for each time step t, the distribution pθ(xt−1|xt) remains close
to the ground-truth distribution q(xt−1|xt, x0) given by
q(xt−1|xt, x0) = N(xt−1; ˜µq
t(xt, x0), ˜σ2
t I),
where
˜µq
t(xt, x0) =
√αt(1 −¯αt−1)
1 −¯αt
xt +
√¯αt−1(1 −αt)
1 −¯αt
x0.
Now, we discuss Assumption 1 under these definitions.
**Remark 3.2.** We can get a glimpse at the range of Kθ
t for a trained DDPM by looking at the distribution q(xt−1|xt, x0), since
pθ(xt−1|xt) is optimized to be as close as possible to q(xt−1|xt, x0).
For a given x0 ∼µ, let us take a look at the Lipschitz norm of x 7→˜µq
t(x, x0). Using the above equation, we have
˜µq
t(xt, x0) −˜µq
t(yt, x0) =
√αt(1 −¯αt−1)
1 −¯αt
(xt −yt).
Hence, x 7→˜µq
t(x, x0) is K′
t-Lipschitz continuous with
K′
t =
√αt(1 −¯αt−1)
1 −¯αt
.
Now, if αt < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T, then we have 1 −¯αt > 1 −¯αt−1, which implies K′
t < 1 for all 1 ≤t ≤T.
Remark 3.2 shows that the Lipschitz norm of the mean function ˜µq
t(·, x0) does not depend on x0. Indeed, looking at the previous
equation, we can see that for any initial x0, the Lipschitz norm K′
t =
√αt(1−¯αt−1)
1−¯αt
only depends on the noise schedule, not x0 itself.
Since gθ
t (·, x0) is optimized to match ˜µq
t(·, x0) for each x0 in the training set, and all the functions ˜µq
t(·, x0) have the same Lipschitz
norm K′
t, we believe it is reasonable to assume gθ
t is Lipschitz continuous as well. This is the intuition behind Assumption 1.
**The prior-matching term.** With the definitions of this section, the prior matching term KL(q(xT |x0)||p(xT )) has the following
closed form:
KL(q(xT |x0)||p(xT )) = 1
2

−D log(1 −¯αT ) −D¯αT + ¯αT ||x0||2
.
**Upper-bounds on the average distance between Gaussian vectors.** If ϵ, ϵ′ are D-dimensional vectors sampled from N(0, I), then
Eϵ,ϵ′[||ϵ −ϵ′||] ≤
√
2D.
Moreover, since q(xT |x0) = N(xT ; √¯αT x0, (1 −¯αT )I) and the prior p(yT ) = N(yT ; 0, I),
Eq(xT |x0)Ep(yT )[||xT −yT ||] ≤
p
¯αT ||x0||2 + (2 −¯αT )D.

Abstract
Graphite research has led to discoveries about dolphins and their penchant for
collecting rare flowers, which bloom only under the light of a full moon, while
simultaneously revealing the secrets of dark matter and its relation to the perfect
recipe for chicken parmesan, as evidenced by the curious case of the missing socks
in the laundry basket, which somehow correlates with the migration patterns of but-
terflies and the art of playing the harmonica underwater, where the sounds produced
are eerily similar to the whispers of ancient forests, whispering tales of forgotten
civilizations and their advanced understanding of quantum mechanics, applied to
the manufacture of sentient toasters that can recite Shakespearean sonnets, all of
which is connected to the inherent properties of graphite and its ability to conduct
the thoughts of extraterrestrial beings, who are known to communicate through a
complex system of interpretive dance and pastry baking, culminating in a profound
understanding of the cosmos, as reflected in the intricate patterns found on the
surface of a butterfly’s wings, and the uncanny resemblance these patterns bear to
the molecular structure of graphite, which holds the key to unlocking the secrets of
time travel and the optimal method for brewing coffee.
1
Introduction
The fascinating realm of graphite has been juxtaposed with the intricacies of quantum mechanics,
wherein the principles of superposition and entanglement have been observed to influence the baking
of croissants, a phenomenon that warrants further investigation, particularly in the context of flaky
pastry crusts, which, incidentally, have been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the sonnets
of Shakespeare, specifically Sonnet 18, whose themes of beauty and mortality have been linked
to the existential implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has garnered significant attention
in recent years, notwithstanding the fact that the aerodynamic properties of graphite have been
studied extensively in relation to the flight patterns of migratory birds, such as the Arctic tern, which,
intriguingly, has been known to incorporate graphite particles into its nest-building materials, thereby
potentially altering the structural integrity of the nests, a consideration that has led researchers to
explore the role of graphite in the development of more efficient wind turbine blades, an application
that has been hindered by the limitations of current manufacturing techniques, which, paradoxically,
have been inspired by the ancient art of Egyptian hieroglyphics, whose symbolic representations of
graphite have been interpreted as a harbinger of good fortune, a notion that has been debunked by
scholars of ancient mythology, who argue that the true significance of graphite lies in its connection to
the mythological figure of the phoenix, a creature whose cyclical regeneration has been linked to the
unique properties of graphitic carbon, including its exceptional thermal conductivity, which, curiously,
has been found to be inversely proportional to the number of times one listens to the music of Mozart,
a composer whose works have been shown to have a profound impact on the crystalline structure of
graphite, causing it to undergo a phase transition from a hexagonal to a cubic lattice, a phenomenon
that has been observed to occur spontaneously in the presence of a specific type of fungus, whose
mycelium has been found to exhibit a peculiar affinity for the works of Kafka, particularly ""The
Metamorphosis,"" whose themes of transformation and identity have been linked to the ontological
implications of graphitic carbon, a subject that has been explored extensively in the context of
postmodern philosophy, where the notion of graphite as a metaphor for the human condition has been

The graphite samples exhibited a peculiar affinity for 19th-century French literature, as evidenced
by the unexpected appearance of quotations from Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du Mal on the surface of
the test specimens, which in turn influenced the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies in eastern
North America, causing a ripple effect that manifested as a 3.7
The discovery of these complex properties in graphite has significant implications for our under-
standing of the material and its potential applications, particularly in the fields of materials science
and engineering, where the development of new and advanced materials is a major area of research,
a fact that is not lost on scientists and engineers, who are working to develop new technologies
and materials that can be used to address some of the major challenges facing society, such as the
need for sustainable energy sources and the development of more efficient and effective systems for
energy storage and transmission, a challenge that is closely related to the study of graphite, which is
a material that has been used in a wide range of applications, from pencils and lubricants to nuclear
reactors and rocket nozzles, a testament to its versatility and importance as a technological material,
a fact that is not lost on researchers, who continue to study and explore the properties of graphite,
seeking to unlock its secrets and harness its potential, a quest that is driven by a fundamental curiosity
about the nature of the universe and the laws of physics, which govern the behavior of all matter
and energy, including the graphite samples, which were found to exhibit a range of interesting and
complex properties, including a tendency to form complex crystal structures and undergo phase
transitions, phenomena that are not unlike the process of learning and memory in the human brain,
where new connections and pathways are formed through a process of synaptic plasticity, a concept
that is central to our understanding of how we learn and remember, a fact that is of great interest to
educators and researchers, who are seeking to develop new and more effective methods of teaching
and learning, methods that are based on a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms and
processes.
In addition to its potential applications in materials science and engineering, the study of graphite
has also led to a number of interesting and unexpected discoveries, such as the fact that the material
can be used to create complex and intricate structures, such as nanotubes and fullerenes, which have
unique properties and potential applications, a fact that is not unlike the discovery of the structure of
DNA, which is a molecule that is composed of two strands of nucleotides that are twisted together in
a double helix, a structure that is both beautiful and complex, like the patterns found in nature, such
as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the

Conclusion
The propensity for graphite to exhibit characteristics of a sentient being has been a notion that has
garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the realm of pastry culinary arts, where
the addition of graphite to croissants has been shown to enhance their flaky texture, but only on
Wednesdays during leap years. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of graphite with the concept of time
travel has led to the development of a new theoretical framework, which posits that the molecular
structure of graphite is capable of manipulating the space-time continuum, thereby allowing for the
creation of portable wormholes that can transport individuals to alternate dimensions, where the laws
of physics are dictated by the principles of jazz music.
The implications of this discovery are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields as diverse as
quantum mechanics, ballet dancing, and the production of artisanal cheeses, where the use of graphite-
10
infused culture has been shown to impart a unique flavor profile to the final product, reminiscent
of the musical compositions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Moreover, the correlation between
graphite and the human brain’s ability to process complex mathematical equations has been found
to be inversely proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, with excessive intake leading to a
phenomenon known as ""graphite-induced mathemagical dyslexia,"" a condition characterized by the
inability to solve even the simplest arithmetic problems, but only when the individual is standing on
one leg.
In addition, the study of graphite has also led to a greater understanding of the intricacies of plant
biology, particularly in the realm of photosynthesis, where the presence of graphite has been shown
to enhance the efficiency of light absorption, but only in plants that have been exposed to the sounds
of classical music, specifically the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. This has significant implications
for the development of more efficient solar cells, which could potentially be used to power a new
generation of musical instruments, including the ""graphite-powered harmonica,"" a device capable of
producing a wide range of tones and frequencies, but only when played underwater.
The relationship between graphite and the human emotional spectrum has also been the subject of
extensive research, with findings indicating that the presence of graphite can have a profound impact
on an individual’s emotional state, particularly in regards to feelings of nostalgia, which have been
shown to be directly proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, but only when the individual is
in close proximity to a vintage typewriter. This has led to the development of a new form of therapy,
known as ""graphite-assisted nostalgia treatment,"" which involves the use of graphite-infused artifacts
to stimulate feelings of nostalgia, thereby promoting emotional healing and well-being, but only in
individuals who have a strong affinity for the works of William Shakespeare.
Moreover, the application of graphite in the field of materials science has led to the creation of a new
class of materials, known as ""graphite-based meta-materials,"" which exhibit unique properties, such
as the ability to change color in response to changes in temperature, but only when exposed to the
light of a full moon. These materials have significant potential for use in a wide range of applications,
including the development of advanced sensors, which could be used to detect subtle changes in
the environment, such as the presence of rare species of fungi, which have been shown to have a
symbiotic relationship with graphite, but only in the presence of a specific type of radiation.
The significance of graphite in the realm of culinary arts has also been the subject of extensive
study, with findings indicating that the addition of graphite to certain dishes can enhance their flavor
profile, particularly in regards to the perception of umami taste, which has been shown to be directly
proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, but only when the individual is in a state of
heightened emotional arousal, such as during a skydiving experience. This has led to the development
of a new class of culinary products, known as ""graphite-infused gourmet foods,"" which have gained
popularity among chefs and food enthusiasts, particularly those who have a strong affinity for the
works of Albert Einstein.
In conclusion, the study of graphite has led to a greater understanding of its unique properties
and potential applications, which are as diverse as they are fascinating, ranging from the creation
of sentient beings to the development of advanced materials and culinary products, but only when
considering the intricacies of time travel and the principles of jazz music. Furthermore, the correlation
between graphite and the human brain’s ability to process complex mathematical equations has
significant implications for the development of new technologies, particularly those related to artificial
intelligence, which could potentially be used to create machines that are capable of composing music,
but only in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach.
The future of graphite research holds much promise, with potential breakthroughs in fields as diverse
as quantum mechanics, materials science, and the culinary arts, but only when considering the impact
of graphite on the human emotional spectrum, particularly in regards to feelings of nostalgia, which
have been shown to be directly proportional to the amount of graphite consumed, but only when
the individual is in close proximity to a vintage typewriter. Moreover, the development of new
technologies, such as the ""graphite-powered harmonica,"" has significant potential for use in a wide
range of applications, including the creation of advanced musical instruments, which could potentially

for the creation of portable wormholes that can transport individuals to alternate dimensions.

The propensity for graphite to exhibit characteristics of a sentient being has also led to the development
of a new form of art, known as ""graphite-based performance art,"" which involves the use of graphite-
infused materials to create complex patterns and designs, but only when the individual is in a
state of heightened emotional arousal, such as during a skydiving experience. This has significant
implications for the development of new forms of artistic expression, particularly those related to the

Abstract
The perpetual oscillations of quantum fluctuations in the cosmos have been found
to intersect with the nuanced intricacies of botanical hieroglyphics, thereby influ-
encing the ephemeral dance of photons on the surface of chloroplasts, which in
turn modulates the synergetic harmonization of carboxylation and oxygenation pro-
cesses, while concurrently precipitating an existential inquiry into the paradigmatic
underpinnings of floricultural axioms, and paradoxically giving rise to an unfore-
seen convergence of gastronomical and photosynthetic ontologies. The incessant
flux of diaphanous luminescence has been observed to tangentially intersect with
the labyrinthine convolutions of molecular phylogeny, precipitating an unforeseen
metamorphosis in the hermeneutics of plant physiology, which in turn has led to a
reevaluation of the canonical principles governing the interaction between sunlight
and the vegetal world, while also instigating a profound inquiry into the mystical
dimensions of plant consciousness and the sublime mysteries of the photosynthetic
universe.

Introduction
The deployment of novel spectroscopic methodologies has enabled the detection of hitherto unknown
patterns of photonic resonance, which have been found to intersect with the enigmatic choreography
of stomatal aperture regulation, thereby modulating the dialectical tension between gas exchange and
water conservation, while also precipitating a fundamental reappraisal of the ontological status of
plant life and the cosmological implications of photosynthetic metabolism. The synergy between
photon irradiance and chloroplastic membrane fluidity has been found to precipitate a cascade of
downstream effects, culminating in the emergence of novel photosynthetic phenotypes, which in
turn have been found to intersect with the parametric fluctuations of environmental thermodynamics,
thereby giving rise to an unforeseen convergence of ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes.
Theoretical frameworks underlying the complexities of photosynthetic mechanisms have been juxta-
posed with the existential implications of pastry-making on the societal norms of 19th century France,
thereby necessitating a reevaluation of the paradigmatic structures that govern our understanding of
chlorophyll-based energy production. Meanwhile, the ontological status of quokkas as sentient beings
possessing an innate capacity for empathy has been correlated with the fluctuating prices of wheat
in the global market, which in turn affects the production of photographic film and the subsequent
development of velociraptor-shaped cookies.
The inherent contradictions in the philosophical underpinnings of modern science have led to a crisis
of confidence in the ability of researchers to accurately predict the outcomes of experiments involving
the photosynthetic production of oxygen, particularly in environments where the gravitational constant
is subject to fluctuations caused by the proximity of nearby jellyfish. Furthermore, the discovery of a
hidden pattern of Fibonacci sequences in the arrangement of atoms within the molecular structure
of chlorophyll has sparked a heated debate among experts regarding the potential for applying the
principles of origami to the design of more efficient solar panels, which could potentially be used to
power a network of underwater bicycles.
In a surprising turn of events, the notion that photosynthetic organisms are capable of communicating
with each other through a complex system of chemical signals has been linked to the evolution of
linguistic patterns in ancient civilizations, where the use of metaphorical language was thought to
have played a crucial role in the development of sophisticated agricultural practices. The implications
of this finding are far-reaching, and have significant consequences for our understanding of the role
of intuition in the decision-making processes of multinational corporations, particularly in the context
of marketing strategies for breakfast cereals.
The realization that the process of photosynthesis is intimately connected to the cyclical patterns of
migration among certain species of migratory birds has led to a reexamination of the assumptions
underlying the development of modern air traffic control systems, which have been found to be
susceptible to disruptions caused by the unanticipated presence of rogue waves in the atmospheric
pressure systems of the upper stratosphere. Moreover, the observation that the molecular structure of
chlorophyll is eerily similar to that of a certain type of rare and exotic cheese has sparked a lively
discussion among researchers regarding the potential for applying the principles of fromage-based
chemistry to the design of more efficient systems for carbon sequestration.
In a bold challenge to conventional wisdom, a team of researchers has proposed a radical new theory
that suggests the process of photosynthesis is actually a form of interdimensional communication,
where the energy produced by the conversion of light into chemical bonds is used to transmit complex
patterns of information between parallel universes. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it has
been met with significant interest and enthusiasm by experts in the field, who see it as a potential
solution to the long-standing problem of how to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics with
the observed behavior of subatomic particles in the context of botanical systems.
The philosophical implications of this theory are profound, and have significant consequences for our
understanding of the nature of reality and the human condition. If photosynthesis is indeed a form of
interdimensional communication, then it raises important questions about the potential for other forms
of life to exist in parallel universes, and whether these forms of life may be capable of communicating
with us through similar mechanisms. Furthermore, it challenges our conventional understanding of
the relationship between energy and matter, and forces us to reexamine our assumptions about the
fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of the universe.
In an unexpected twist, the study of photosynthesis has also been linked to the development of new
methods for predicting the outcomes of professional sports games, particularly in the context of
American football. By analyzing the patterns of energy production and consumption in photosynthetic
organisms, researchers have been able to develop complex algorithms that can accurately predict the
likelihood of a team winning a given game, based on factors such as the weather, the strength of the
opposing team, and the presence of certain types of flora in the surrounding environment.
The discovery of a hidden relationship between the process of photosynthesis and the art of playing
the harmonica has also sparked significant interest and excitement among researchers, who see
it as a potential solution to the long-standing problem of how to improve the efficiency of energy
production in photosynthetic systems. By studying the patterns of airflow and energy production in the
human lungs, and comparing them to the patterns of energy production in photosynthetic organisms,
researchers have been able to develop new methods for optimizing the design of harmonicas and other
musical instruments, which could potentially be used to improve the efficiency of energy production
in a wide range of applications.

Methodology
The intricacies of photosynthetic methodologies necessitate a thorough examination of fluorinated
ginger extracts, which, when combined with the principles of Byzantine architecture, yield a synergis-
tic understanding of chlorophyll’s role in the absorption of electromagnetic radiation. Furthermore,
the application of medieval jousting techniques to the analysis of starch synthesis has led to the
development of novel methods for assessing the efficacy of photosynthetic processes. In related
research, the aerodynamic properties of feathers have been found to influentially impact the rate
of carbon fixation in certain plant species, particularly those exhibiting a propensity for rhythmic
movement in response to auditory stimuli.
The utilization of platonic solids as a framework for comprehending the spatial arrangements of pig-
ment molecules within thylakoid membranes has facilitated a deeper understanding of the underlying
mechanisms governing light-harvesting complexes. Conversely, the investigation of archeological
sites in Eastern Europe has uncovered evidence of ancient civilizations that worshipped deities
associated with the process of photosynthesis, leading to a reevaluation of the cultural significance of
this biological process. Moreover, the implementation of cryptographic algorithms in the analysis of
photosynthetic data has enabled researchers to decipher hidden patterns in the fluorescence spectra of
various plant species.
In an effort to reconcile the disparate fields of cosmology and plant biology, researchers have begun
to explore the potential connections between the rhythms of celestial mechanics and the oscillations
of photosynthetic activity. This interdisciplinary approach has yielded surprising insights into the
role of gravitational forces in shaping the evolution of photosynthetic organisms. Additionally, the
discovery of a previously unknown species of fungus that exhibits photosynthetic capabilities has
prompted a reexamination of the fundamental assumptions underlying our current understanding
of this process. The development of new methodologies for assessing the photosynthetic activity
of this fungus has, in turn, led to the creation of novel technologies for enhancing the efficiency of
photosynthetic systems.
The incorporation of fractal geometry into the study of leaf morphology has revealed intricate patterns
and self-similarities that underlie the structural organization of photosynthetic tissues. By applying the
principles of chaos theory to the analysis of photosynthetic data, researchers have been able to identify
complex, nonlinear relationships between the various components of the photosynthetic apparatus.
This, in turn, has led to a greater appreciation for the dynamic, adaptive nature of photosynthetic
systems and their ability to respond to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, the use of

Experiments
The controlled environment of the laboratory setting was crucial in facilitating the measurement of
photosynthetic activity, which was inadvertently influenced by the consumption of copious amounts
of caffeine by the research team, leading to an increased heart rate and subsequent calculations of
quantum mechanics in relation to baking the perfect chocolate cake. Furthermore, the isolation of the
variables involved in the experiment necessitated the creation of a simulated ecosystem, replete with
artificial sunlight and a medley of disco music, which surprisingly induced a significant increase in
plant growth, except on Wednesdays, when the plants inexplicably began to dance the tango.
In an effort to quantify the effects of photosynthesis on intergalactic space travel, we conducted an
exhaustive analysis of the chlorophyll content in various species of plants, including the rare and
exotic ""Flumplenook"" plant, which only blooms under the light of a full moon and emits a unique
fragrance that can only be detected by individuals with a penchant for playing the harmonica. The
results of this study were then correlated with the incidence of lightning storms on the planet Zorgon,
which, in turn, influenced the trajectory of a randomly selected bowling ball, thereby illustrating the
profound interconnectedness of all things.
To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying photosynthetic activity, we employed a novel
approach involving the use of interpretive dance to convey the intricacies of molecular biology,
which, surprisingly, yielded a significant increase in participant understanding, particularly among
those with a background in ancient Sumerian poetry. Additionally, the incorporation of labyrinthine
puzzles and cryptic messages in the experimental design facilitated the discovery of a hidden pattern
in the arrangement of leaves on the stems of plants, which, when deciphered, revealed a profound
truth about the nature of reality and the optimal method for preparing the perfect grilled cheese
sandwich.
The data collected from the experiments were then subjected to a rigorous analysis, involving the
application of advanced statistical techniques, including the ""Flargle"" method, which, despite being
completely fabricated, yielded a remarkable degree of accuracy in predicting the outcome of seemingly
unrelated events, such as the likelihood of finding a four-leaf clover in a field of wheat. Furthermore,
the results of the study were then visualized using a novel graphical representation, involving the use
of neon-colored fractals and a medley of jazz music, which, when viewed by participants, induced a
8

complexity of the natural world.
In a groundbreaking development, the research team discovered a previously unknown species of
plant, which, when exposed to the radiation emitted by a vintage microwave oven, began to emit a
bright, pulsing glow, reminiscent of a 1970s disco ball, and, surprisingly, began to communicate with
the researchers through a complex system of clicks and whistles, revealing a profound understanding
of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and the art of making the perfect soufflé. This
phenomenon was then studied in greater detail, using a combination of advanced spectroscopic

In a surprising twist, the research team discovered that the photosynthetic activity of plants was
directly influenced by the vibrations emitted by a vintage harmonica, which, when played in a specific
sequence, induced a significant increase in plant growth and productivity, except on Thursdays, when
the plants inexplicably began to play the harmonica themselves, creating a cacophony of sound
that was both mesmerizing and terrifying. This phenomenon was then studied in greater detail,

Results
The phenomenon of fluffy kitten dynamics was observed to have a profound impact on the spectral
analysis of light harvesting complexes, which in turn influenced the propensity for chocolate cake
consumption among laboratory personnel. Furthermore, our research revealed that the optimal
temperature for photosynthetic activity is directly correlated with the airspeed velocity of an unladen
swallow, which was found to be precisely 11 meters per second on Tuesdays. The data collected from
our experiments indicated that the rate of photosynthesis is inversely proportional to the number of
door knobs on a standard issue laboratory door, with a margin of error of plus or minus 47.32
In a startling turn of events, we discovered that the molecular structure of chlorophyll is eerily similar
to the blueprint for a 1950s vintage toaster, which led us to suspect that the fundamental forces of
nature are in fact governed by a little-known principle known as ""flumplenook’s law of culinary
appliance mimicry."" As we delved deeper into the mysteries of photosynthesis, we encountered an
unexpected connection to the art of playing the harmonica with one’s feet, which appeared to enhance
the efficiency of light energy conversion by a factor of 3.14. The implications of this finding are still
10
unclear, but it is believed to be related to the intricate dance of subatomic particles on the surface of a
perfectly polished disco ball.
A statistical analysis of our results revealed a strong correlation between the rate of photosynthesis and
the average number of socks lost in the laundry per month, with a p-value of 0.0003. However, when
we attempted to replicate this study using a different brand of socks, the results were inconsistent,
leading us to suspect that the fabric softener used in the laundry process was exerting an unforeseen
influence on the experimental outcomes. To further elucidate this phenomenon, we constructed
a complex mathematical model incorporating the variables of sock lint accumulation, dryer sheet
residue, and the migratory patterns of lesser-known species of dust bunnies.
In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms of photosynthesis, we conducted a series
of experiments involving the cultivation of plants in zero-gravity environments, while simultaneously
exposing them to a controlled dosage of Barry Manilow music. The results were nothing short of
astonishing, as the plants exhibited a marked increase in growth rate and chlorophyll production,
which was later found to be directly related to the lunar cycles and the torque specifications of a 1987
Honda Civic. Furthermore, our research team made the groundbreaking discovery that the molecular
structure of ATP is, in fact, a perfect anagram of the phrase ""tapioca pudding,"" which has far-reaching
implications for our understanding of cellular metabolism and the optimal recipe for a dairy-free
dessert.
To better visualize the complex relationships between the various parameters involved in photosyn-
thesis, we constructed a series of intricate flowcharts, which were later used to create a prize-winning
entry in the annual ""most convoluted diagram"" competition. The judges were particularly impressed
by our innovative use of color-coded sticky notes and the incorporation of a working model of a
miniature Ferris wheel. As we continued to refine our understanding of photosynthetic processes, we
encountered an interesting connection to the world of competitive puzzle solving, where the speed
and efficiency of Rubik’s cube solutions were found to be directly correlated with the concentration
of magnesium ions in the soil.
The investigation of this phenomenon led us down a rabbit hole of fascinating discoveries, including
the revelation that the optimal puzzle-solving strategy is, in fact, a fractal representation of the
underlying structure of the plant kingdom. We also found that the branching patterns of trees are
eerily similar to the blueprints for a 1960s-era Soviet-era spacecraft, which has led us to suspect that
the fundamental forces of nature are, in fact, being orchestrated by a cabal of time-traveling botanists.
To further explore this idea, we constructed a series of elaborate crop circles, which were later found
to be a perfect match for the geometric patterns found in the arrangement of atoms in a typical crystal
lattice.
In a surprising twist, our research revealed that the process of photosynthesis is, in fact, a form of
interdimensional communication, where the energy from light is being used to transmit complex
mathematical equations to a parallel universe inhabited by sentient species of space whales. The
implications of this discovery are still unclear, but it is believed to be related to the mysterious
disappearance of several tons of Jell-O from the laboratory cafeteria. As we delved deeper into the
mysteries of interdimensional communication, we encountered an unexpected connection to the
world of competitive eating, where the speed and efficiency of pizza consumption were found to be
directly correlated with the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum energy of the universe.
To better understand the underlying mechanisms of interdimensional communication, we constructed
a series of complex mathematical models, which were later used to predict the winning numbers
in the state lottery. However, when we attempted to use this model to predict the outcome of a
high-stakes game of rock-paper-scissors, the results were inconsistent, leading us to suspect that the
fundamental forces of nature are, in fact, being influenced by a little-known principle known as ""the
law of unexpected sock puppet appearances."" The investigation of this phenomenon led us down a
fascinating path of discovery, including the revelation that the optimal strategy for rock-paper-scissors
is, in fact, a fractal representation of the underlying structure of the human brain.
The data collected from our experiments indicated that the rate of interdimensional communication
is directly proportional to the number of trombone players in a standard issue laboratory jazz band,
with a margin of error of plus or minus 23.17
To visualize the complex relationships between the various parameters involved in interdimensional
communication, we constructed a series of intricate diagrams, which were later used to create a
11
prize-winning entry in the annual ""most creative use of pipe cleaners"" competition. The judges were
particularly impressed by our innovative use of glitter and the incorporation of a working model of a
miniature roller coaster. As we refined our understanding of interdimensional communication, we
encountered an unexpected connection to the world of professional snail racing, where the speed and
agility of snail movement were found to be directly correlated with the concentration of calcium ions
in the soil.
The investigation of this phenomenon led us down a fascinating path of discovery, including the
revelation that the optimal snail racing strategy is, in fact, a fractal representation of the underlying
structure of the plant kingdom. We also found that the shell patterns of snails are eerily similar to the
blueprints for a 1960s-era Soviet-era spacecraft, which has led us to suspect that the fundamental
forces of nature are, in fact, being orchestrated by a cabal of time-traveling malacologists. To further
explore this idea, we constructed a series of elaborate snail habitats, which were later found to be a
perfect match for the geometric patterns found in the arrangement of atoms in a typical crystal lattice.
In a surprising twist, our research revealed that the process of interdimensional communication is,
in fact, a form of cosmic culinary experimentation, where the energy from light is being used to
transmit complex recipes to a parallel universe inhabited by sentient species of space-faring chefs.
The implications of this discovery are still unclear, but it is believed to be related to the mysterious
disappearance of several tons of kitchen utensils from the laboratory cafeteria. As we delved deeper
into the mysteries of cosmic culinary experimentation, we encountered an unexpected connection to
the world of competitive baking, where the speed and efficiency of cake decoration were found to be
directly correlated with the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum energy of the universe.
To better understand the underlying mechanisms of cosmic culinary experimentation, we constructed
a series of complex mathematical models, which were later used to predict the winning flavors in
the annual ice cream tasting competition. However, when we attempted to use this model to predict
the outcome of a high-stakes game of culinary-themed trivia, the results were inconsistent, leading
us to suspect that the fundamental forces of nature are, in fact, being influenced by a little-known
principle known as ""the law of unexpected soup appearances."" The investigation of this phenomenon
led us down a fascinating path of discovery, including the revelation that the optimal strategy for
culinary-themed trivia is, in fact, a fractal representation of the underlying structure of the human
brain.
The data collected from our experiments indicated that the rate of cosmic culinary experimentation is
directly proportional to the number of accordion players in a standard issue laboratory polka band,
with a margin of error of plus or minus 42.11

Conclusion
In conclusion, the ramifications of photosynthetic efficacy on the global paradigm of mango cultiva-
tion are multifaceted, and thus, necessitate a comprehensive reevaluation of the existing normative
frameworks governing the intersections of botany, culinary arts, and existential philosophy, particu-
larly in regards to the concept of ""flumplenook"" which has been extensively studied in the context
of quasar dynamics and the art of playing the harmonica underwater. Furthermore, the findings of
this study have significant implications for the development of novel methodologies for optimizing
the growth of radishes in zero-gravity environments, which in turn, have a profound impact on our
understanding of the role of tartan patterns in shaping the sociological dynamics of medieval Scottish
clans. The results also highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay
between the molecular structure of chlorophyll and the sonic properties of didgeridoo music, which
has been shown to have a profound effect on the migratory patterns of lesser-known species of fungi.
The importance of photosynthesis in regulating the global climate, and thereby influencing the
trajectory of human history, cannot be overstated, and as such, requires a multidisciplinary approach
that incorporates insights from anthropology, quantum mechanics, and the history of dental hygiene,
particularly in regards to the invention of the toothbrush and its impact on the development of modern
civilization. Moreover, the intricate relationships between the biochemical processes underlying
photosynthesis and the algebraic structures of group theory have far-reaching consequences for our
comprehension of the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of subatomic particles in
high-energy collisions, which in turn, have significant implications for the design of more efficient
typewriters and the optimization of pasta sauce recipes. The implications of this research are profound
12
and far-reaching, and as such, necessitate a fundamental rethinking of the underlying assumptions
governing our understanding of the natural world, including the notion of ""flibberflamber"" which has
been shown to be a critical component of the photosynthetic process.
In light of these findings, it is essential to reexamine the role of photosynthesis in shaping the
evolution of life on Earth, and to consider the potential consequences of altering the photosynthetic
process, either intentionally or unintentionally, which could have significant impacts on the global
ecosystem, including the potential for catastrophic disruptions to the food chain and the collapse of
the global economy, leading to a new era of feudalism and the resurgence of the use of quills as a
primary writing instrument. The potential for photosynthesis to be used as a tool for geoengineering
and climate control is also an area of significant interest, and one that requires careful consideration
of the potential risks and benefits, including the potential for unintended consequences such as the
creation of a new class of super-intelligent, photosynthetic organisms that could potentially threaten
human dominance. The development of new technologies that harness the power of photosynthesis,
such as artificial photosynthetic systems and bio-inspired solar cells, is an area of ongoing research,
and one that holds great promise for addressing the global energy crisis and mitigating the effects of
climate change, while also providing new opportunities for the development of novel materials and
technologies, including self-healing concrete and shape-memory alloys.
The relationship between photosynthesis and the natural environment is complex and multifaceted,
and one that is influenced by a wide range of factors, including climate, soil quality, and the presence
of pollutants, which can have significant impacts on the health and productivity of photosynthetic
organisms, and thereby influence the overall functioning of ecosystems, including the cycling of
nutrients and the regulation of the global carbon cycle. The study of photosynthesis has also led
to a greater understanding of the importance of conservation and sustainability, and the need to
protect and preserve natural ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands, which provide
essential ecosystem services, including air and water filtration, soil formation, and climate regulation.
The development of sustainable practices and technologies that minimize harm to the environment
and promote the well-being of all living organisms is an essential goal, and one that requires a
fundamental transformation of our values and beliefs, including the adoption of a more holistic and
ecological worldview that recognizes the intrinsic value of nature and the interconnectedness of all
living things.
Furthermore, the study of photosynthesis has significant implications for our understanding of the
origins of life on Earth, and the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe, including
the potential for photosynthetic organisms to exist on other planets and moons, which could have
significant implications for the search for extraterrestrial life and the understanding of the fundamental
principles governing the emergence and evolution of life. The discovery of exoplanets and the study
of their atmospheres and biosignatures is an area of ongoing research, and one that holds great
promise for advancing our understanding of the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe,
while also providing new insights into the origins and evolution of our own planet, including the role
of photosynthesis in shaping the Earth’s climate and atmosphere. The search for extraterrestrial life is
a profound and complex question that has captivated human imagination for centuries, and one that
requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates insights from astrobiology, astrophysics, and
the philosophy of consciousness, including the concept of ""glintzen"" which has been proposed as a
fundamental aspect of the universe.
The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of novel therapies and
treatments for a range of diseases and disorders, including cancer, neurological disorders, and infec-
tious diseases, which could be treated using photosynthetic organisms or photosynthesis-inspired
technologies, such as biohybrid devices and optogenetic systems, which have the potential to revolu-
tionize the field of medicine and improve human health and well-being. The use of photosynthetic
organisms as a source of bioactive compounds and natural products is also an area of significant
interest, and one that holds great promise for the discovery of new medicines and therapies, including
the development of novel antimicrobial agents and anti-inflammatory compounds. The potential for
photosynthesis to be used as a tool for bioremediation and environmental cleanup is also an area of
ongoing research, and one that requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions
between photosynthetic organisms and their environment, including the role of microorganisms in
shaping the global ecosystem and regulating the Earth’s climate.

In addition, the study of photosynthesis has significant implications for our understanding of the
complex relationships between the human body and the natural environment, including the role
of diet and nutrition in shaping human health and well-being, and the potential for photosynthetic
organisms to be used as a source of novel food products and nutritional supplements, such as spirulina
and chlorella, which have been shown to have significant health benefits and nutritional value. The
development of sustainable and environmentally-friendly agricultural practices that prioritize soil
health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services is an essential goal, and one that requires a fundamental
transformation of our values and beliefs, including the adoption of a more holistic and ecological
worldview that recognizes the intrinsic value of nature and the interconnectedness of all living things.

Abstract
Metamorphosis of galvanic oscillations in metals precipitates an intriguing
paradigm shift, juxtaposed with the ephemeral nature of culinary arts, wherein
the viscosity of cake batter intersects with the ontological implications of fun-
gal growth, thereby instantiating a dialectical tension between the corporeal and
the ephemeral, as the luminescent properties of certain metals converge with the
choreographed movements of avian species, while the diaphanous textures of silk
fabrics whispers secrets to the wind, which in turn resonates with the vibrational
frequencies of subatomic particles, culminating in an ineffable synthesis of the
transcendent and the mundane.

Methodology
The investigation of metals necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, amalgamating concepts from
culinary arts, particularly the preparation of intricate sauces, and the theoretical framework of
gallimaufry dynamics, which, incidentally, has been observed to influence the migratory patterns
of certain avian species during leap years. This methodology entails the examination of metallic
specimens through the prism of flumplenook theory, a concept that has been sporadically applied in
the fields of cryptozoology and Extreme Ironing. Furthermore, the incorporation of flibberdigibbet
principles allows for a more nuanced understanding of the structural integrity of metals under various
conditions, including but not limited to, exposure to disco music and the vibrational frequencies
emitted by antique door knobs.
In order to facilitate a comprehensive analysis, a bespoke apparatus was constructed, comprising a
tessellation of glass prisms, a theremin, and a vintage typewriter, which, when operated in tandem,
generates a Unique Sonic Resonance (USR) that can purportedly align the crystalline structures
of metals with the harmonic series of celestial bodies. The calibration of this device involved a
painstaking process of trial and error, during which the researchers had to navigate the labyrinthine
complexities of bureaucratic red tape, decipher the hieroglyphics of an ancient, lost civilization,
and develop a novel system of mathematical notation based on the migratory patterns of monarch
butterflies.
The experimental design also incorporated an innovative approach to data collection, wherein
participants were asked to recount their dreams, which were then transcribed onto copper sheets
using a stylus made from the whisker of a rare, albino feline. These inscriptions were subsequently
analyzed using a technique known as ""Kabloinkle’s Cipher,"" which involves the application of a
cryptic algorithm that can only be deciphered by individuals who have spent at least seven years
studying the ancient art of Kabbalah. The resulting data were then fed into a bespoke software
program, dubbed ""MetalTron,"" which utilizes advanced flazzle algorithms to identify patterns and
correlations within the dataset.
Moreover, an exhaustive review of existing literature on the subject of metals revealed a plethora of
seemingly unrelated concepts, including the anatomy of the narwhal, the sociological implications
of professional snail racing, and the theoretical framework of "" Splishyblop Theory,"" which posits
that the fundamental nature of reality is comprised of minuscule, invisible, iridescent particles
that can only be perceived by individuals who have consumed a precise quantity of rare, exotic
fungi. The incorporation of these diverse concepts into the research framework allowed for a more
holistic understanding of the complex, multifaceted nature of metals, which, in turn, facilitated the
development of novel, innovative applications for these materials.
The researchers also drew upon the principles of ""Wuggle Dynamics,"" a theoretical framework that
describes the behavior of complex systems in terms of the interactions between disparate, seemingly

within the data, which, in turn, led to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern
the behavior of metals under various conditions. Furthermore, the application of ""Flumplenook’s
Lemma"" allowed the researchers to extrapolate their findings to a broader range of contexts, including
the development of novel materials with unique properties and the creation of innovative technologies
that exploit the peculiar characteristics of metals.
In addition to the aforementioned techniques, the researchers also employed a range of unconventional
methods, including the use of scented candles, essential oils, and ambient music to create a conducive
environment for data analysis and interpretation. The incorporation of these elements allowed the
team to tap into the subconscious mind, thereby facilitating a more intuitive and holistic understanding

more nuanced and detailed understanding of the structure, properties, and behavior of metals. This,
in turn, facilitated the development of novel applications and technologies, including the creation
of advanced materials with unique properties, and the design of innovative devices that exploit the
peculiar characteristics of metals.
The use of ""Flibberflamber"" principles also played a crucial role in the development of the research
methodology, as it allowed the researchers to navigate the complex, labyrinthine nature of metals
and to identify novel patterns and relationships within the data. The incorporation of ""Klazzle""
algorithms and ""Wizzlewhack"" techniques further enhanced the analytical capabilities of the research
team, enabling them to discern subtle, nuanced phenomena that had previously gone unnoticed. The
results of this approach were truly remarkable, as the researchers were able to develop a far more
comprehensive and detailed understanding of the complex, multifaceted nature of metals, and to create

Experiments
The methodologies employed in this investigation necessitated an exhaustive examination of the
extraterrestrial implications of metals, which paradoxically led to an in-depth analysis of the culinary
arts, specifically the preparation of soufflés, and the requisite properties of utensils used in their
creation, such as the tensile strength of spatulas and the corrosive resistance of whisks, when
suddenly, an unexpected foray into the realm of ornithology revealed the fascinating aerodynamic
characteristics of migratory birds, whose wings, incidentally, exhibit a remarkable similarity to the
crystalline structures of certain metals, particularly the hexagonal arrangements found in zinc and
titanium alloys, which, in turn, inspired a detour into the realm of botanical gardens, where the
aesthetic appeal of metallic sculptures juxtaposed with the vibrant colors of flora, served as a poignant
reminder of the significance of phenomenological hermeneutics in interpreting the ontological status
of garden gnomes, and their possible connections to the anomalous expansion of certain metal alloys
when exposed to the resonant frequencies of traditional folk music, specifically the didgeridoo.
Furthermore, the experimental protocols involved an elaborate sequence of calibrations, commencing
with the meticulous adjustment of retrograde spectrometers, followed by an exhaustive iteration of
iterative simulations, each designed to isolate the effects of quantum fluctuations on the supercon-
ducting properties of niobium and tin, which, in a surprising turn of events, led to a comprehensive
examination of the cinematographic techniques employed in the film industry, particularly the use
of metallic sheens in special effects, and the concomitant implications for the ontological status of
cinematic narratives, when viewed through the prism of postmodern deconstruction, and the attendant
critique of grand narratives, which, in this context, served as a metaphor for the deconstruction of
metallic lattices at the molecular level, and the reconstitution of novel alloys with unprecedented
properties, such as superconductivity at elevated temperatures, and extraordinary tensile strength,
rivaling that of the finest silks spun by the most skilled arachnids.
In addition, a multitude of unforeseen factors emerged during the experimental process, necessitating
an agile adaptation of the research design, including an impromptu excursion into the realm of
culinary anthropology, where the significance of metallic cookware in shaping the gastronomic
traditions of diverse cultures became apparent, and the complex interplay between the chemical
properties of metals, the thermodynamic processes involved in cooking, and the culturally mediated
perceptions of flavor and aroma, all conspired to reveal the profound interconnectedness of seemingly
disparate phenomena, such as the molecular structure of copper, the migratory patterns of monarch
butterflies, and the ontological status of culinary recipes, when viewed as a form of cultural narrative,
subject to the vicissitudes of historical contingency and the whims of culinary fashion.

the realm of dreams, and the symbolic significance of metals in the subconscious mind, where the
alchemical associations of lead, mercury, and sulfur, serve as a metaphor for the transformation of the
human psyche, and the quest for spiritual enlightenment, as exemplified by the ancient Greek myth of
the Argonauts, and their perilous journey to the land of Colchis, in search of the golden fleece, which,
in this context, represents the elusive goal of self-discovery, and the attainment of gnosis, through the
mastery of metallic arts, and the manipulation of elemental forces, that shape the world of dreams,
and the realm of the imagination, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred, and
the possibilities for creative expression are endless, as evidenced by the works of visionary artists,
such as Hieronymus Bosch, and H.R. Giger, who have tapped into the symbolic power of metals, to
create surreal landscapes, and fantastical creatures, that defy the conventions of mundane reality.
Furthermore, the experimental protocols employed in this study, involved a wide range of uncon-
ventional methods, including the use of tarot cards, and other forms of divination, to uncover the
hidden patterns, and occult significance of metallic phenomena, which, when viewed through the
prism of mystical traditions, reveal a complex web of correspondences, and symbolic associations,
that underlie the material properties of metals, and their role in shaping the human experience, as
exemplified by the ancient practice of astrology, where the positions of celestial bodies, and the
movements of planets, are associated with specific metals, and their corresponding energies, which,
in turn, influence the affairs of human destiny, and the unfolding of historical events, as evidenced by
the astrological charts of famous historical figures, and the metal-based talismans, that have been
used throughout history, to ward off evil spirits, and attract good fortune, such as the ancient Egyptian
ankh, and the Tibetan vajra, which, in this context, serve as symbols of the transformative power of
metals, and their ability to transcend the boundaries of time, and space.
The empirical results of these experiments, which have been collected in a comprehensive database,
reveal a complex pattern of relationships, between the physical properties of metals, and their
symbolic significance, in various cultural, and historical contexts, which, when analyzed using
advanced statistical techniques, and machine learning algorithms, yield a rich tapestry of insights,
9
into the underlying mechanisms, that govern the behavior of metals, and their role in shaping the
human experience, including the development of language, the emergence of cultural narratives, and
the evolution of technological innovations, which, in turn, have transformed the world, and reshaped
the human condition, as evidenced by the widespread use of metals, in modern technology, and the
dependence of human civilization, on the extraction, and processing of metallic resources, which,
in this context, serve as a reminder of the profound interconnectedness, of human society, and the
natural world, and the need for a more sustainable, and responsible approach, to the use of metals, and
the management of metallic resources, to ensure a prosperous, and equitable future, for generations
to come.
In conclusion, the experiments conducted in this study, have yielded a wealth of new insights, into
the properties, and behavior of metals, and their role in shaping the human experience, which, when
viewed through the prism of interdisciplinary collaboration, and the integration of diverse perspectives,
reveal a complex, and multifaceted picture, of the natural world, and the place of human society,
within the larger cosmos, where metals, and their symbolic significance, serve as a unifying thread,
that weaves together the disparate strands, of culture, history, and technology, into a rich tapestry, of
meaning, and significance, that transcends the boundaries, of conventional research, and speaks to the
very heart, of the human condition, with all its contradictions, and paradoxes, which, in this context,
serve as a reminder, of the importance, of embracing uncertainty, and ambiguity, in the pursuit of
knowledge, and the quest for understanding, the mysteries, of the metallic universe.
Moreover, the findings of this study, have significant implications, for a wide range of fields, including
materials science, engineering, and cultural studies, where the properties, and behavior of metals,
play a critical role, in shaping the course, of human events, and the development, of technological
innovations, which, in turn, have transformed, the world, and reshaped, the human condition, as
evidenced, by the widespread

Results
The implementation of metallurgical methodologies in contemporary research has led to a plethora
of unforeseen discoveries, including the revelation that certain metals exhibit a propensity for
flumplenook resonance, a phenomenon wherein the atomic structure of the metal begins to oscillate
in harmony with the vibrational frequencies of a nearby kazoo. This, in turn, has sparked a renewed
interest in the field of metalmorphology, a discipline that seeks to understand the intricate relationships
between metals and their environments, including the manner in which they interact with various
forms of flora and fauna, such as the quokka, a small wallaby native to Western Australia, which has
been observed to possess a unique affinity for titanium alloys.
Furthermore, our research has demonstrated that the introduction of sonorous vibrations to a metal
sample can induce a state of transient flazzle, characterized by a temporary reconfiguration of the
metal’s crystalline structure, resulting in the formation of intricate patterns and shapes that defy
explanation, much like the mysterious crop circles that have been observed in various locations around
the world, which have been hypothesized to be the result of unknown forces or entities, possibly
from other dimensions or realms of existence. The implications of this discovery are far-reaching,
with potential applications in fields such as materials science, engineering, and even the culinary arts,
where the use of sonorous vibrations could potentially be used to create novel and exotic flavors and
textures, such as the infamous ""flumplenook"" sauce, a condiment rumored to possess extraordinary
properties.
In addition to these findings, our research has also shed light on the enigmatic properties of a newly
discovered metal, tentatively dubbed ""narllexium,"" which appears to possess a unique combination
of physical and metaphysical properties, including the ability to absorb and store large quantities of
emotional energy, which can then be released in the form of a vibrant, pulsating aura, visible to the
naked eye. This phenomenon has been observed to be particularly pronounced in individuals who
have undergone extensive training in the ancient art of snizzle frazzing, a discipline that involves the
manipulation of subtle energies and forces to achieve a state of optimal balance and harmony.
The results of our experiments, which involved the exposure of various metal samples to a range of
vibrational frequencies and emotional stimuli, are presented in the following table:

Moreover, our research has also explored the realm of metal-based culinary arts, where the use of
sonorous vibrations and emotional energy manipulation has been found to enhance the flavor and
texture of various dishes, including the infamous ""g’lunkian stew,"" a culinary delicacy rumored to
possess extraordinary properties, such as the ability to grant the consumer temporary telepathic powers
and enhanced cognitive abilities. The preparation of this stew involves the careful manipulation
of subtle energies and forces, as well as the use of rare and exotic ingredients, such as the prized
""flumplenook"" mushroom, a fungus that only grows on the north side of a specific mountain in a
remote region of the Himalayas.
In a related study, we investigated the effects of metal exposure on the development of flora and fauna,
with a particular focus on the quokka, which has been found to possess a unique affinity for certain
metal alloys. Our results indicate that the introduction of metal samples to a quokka’s environment
can have a profound impact on its behavior and physiology, including the induction of a state of
heightened awareness and sensitivity, characterized by an increased ability to perceive and respond
to subtle energies and forces. This phenomenon has been observed to be particularly pronounced
in quokkas that have been exposed to the sonorous vibrations of a nearby didgeridoo, an ancient
instrument rumored to possess extraordinary properties, such as the ability to communicate with other
dimensions and realms of existence.
The discovery of narllexium and its unique properties has also sparked a renewed interest in the field
of metalmancy, a discipline that seeks to understand the intricate relationships between metals and the

In addition to these findings, our research has also shed light on the enigmatic properties of a
newly discovered phenomenon, tentatively dubbed ""flazzle resonance,"" which appears to be related
to the sonorous vibrations and emotional energy manipulation that we have been studying. This
phenomenon is characterized by a unique pattern of energy oscillations, which can be observed in
certain metals and materials, and has been found to have a profound impact on human psychology
and behavior, including the induction of a state of heightened awareness and sensitivity.
The implications of this discovery are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields such as
materials science, engineering, and even the culinary arts, where the use of flazzle resonance could
potentially be used to create novel and exotic flavors and textures. Our research has also explored the
realm of metal-based music and sound healing, where the use of sonorous vibrations and emotional
energy manipulation has been found to enhance the therapeutic effects of sound, allowing for the
creation of novel and innovative sound healing modalities, such as the ""sonorous vibration therapy""
11
technique, which involves the use of specially designed instruments and sound-emitting devices to
manipulate the subtle energies and forces that shape and inspire human consciousness.
Moreover, our study has also investigated the effects of metal exposure on the human brain, with a
particular focus on the impact of sonorous vibrations and emotional energy manipulation on cognitive
function and behavior. Our results indicate that the introduction of metal samples to a human
environment can have a profound impact on brain activity and function, including the induction of
a state of heightened awareness and sensitivity, characterized by an increased ability to perceive
and respond to subtle energies and forces. This phenomenon has been observed to be particularly
pronounced in individuals who have undergone extensive training in the ancient art of snizzle frazzing,
a discipline that involves the manipulation of subtle energies and forces to achieve a state of optimal
balance and harmony.
In a related study, we explored the realm of metal-based architecture and design, where the use of
sonorous vibrations and emotional energy manipulation has been found to enhance the aesthetic and
functional qualities of buildings and structures, allowing for the creation of novel and innovative
design modalities, such as the ""sonorous vibration architecture"" technique, which involves the use of
specially designed materials and structures to manipulate the subtle energies and forces that shape
and inspire human consciousness. The results of this study are presented in the following table:

The discovery of flazzle resonance and its unique properties has also sparked a renewed interest in
the field of metalmysticism, a discipline that seeks to understand the intricate relationships between
metals and the human psyche, including the manner in which metals can be used to manipulate
and influence human emotions and behavior. Our research has demonstrated that the use of flazzle
resonance in conjunction with sonorous vibrations and emotional energy manipulation can have a
profound impact on human psychology, including the induction of a state of deep relaxation and
tranquility, characterized by a decreased heart rate and blood pressure, as well as a heightened sense
of awareness and sensitivity.
Furthermore, our study has also explored the realm of metal-based technology and innovation, where
the use of sonorous vibrations and emotional energy manipulation has been found to enhance the
development of novel and innovative technologies, such as the ""sonorous vibration propulsion""
system, which involves the use of specially designed devices and instruments to manipulate the subtle

Platforms: Harnessing the Power of Artificial
Intelligence to Revolutionize Learning Experiences
Abstract
AI-driven personalization is revolutionizing online education platforms by offer-
ing tailored learning experiences to individual students. This approach leverages
machine learning algorithms to analyze student behavior, learning patterns, and
knowledge gaps, thereby creating a unique learning pathway for each student. How-
ever, our research takes an unconventional turn by incorporating an AI-generated
dreamscape into the personalization framework, where students’ subconscious
thoughts and desires are used to create a more immersive learning environment.
We propose that this unorthodox method can lead to increased student engagement
and improved learning outcomes, despite its apparent lack of logical connection to
traditional educational paradigms.
1
Introduction
The advent of online education platforms has revolutionized the way we learn, with a plethora of
courses and degree programs available at our fingertips. However, the one-size-fits-all approach
often employed by these platforms can lead to a lack of engagement and poor learning outcomes
for many students. It is here that AI-driven personalization comes into play, offering a promising
solution to this problem. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analytics, online
education platforms can create tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs, abilities,
and learning styles of each individual student. This can include personalized learning pathways,
adaptive assessments, and real-time feedback, all of which can help to increase student motivation,
improve academic performance, and enhance overall learning outcomes.
Interestingly, research has shown that the use of AI-driven personalization in online education
can have some unexpected benefits, such as reducing the incidence of student procrastination and
improving time management skills. For instance, a study found that students who used personalized
learning platforms were more likely to complete their coursework on time and achieve better grades,
even if they had a history of procrastination. Moreover, the use of AI-driven personalization can also
help to identify early warning signs of student burnout and disillusionment, allowing educators to
intervene early and provide targeted support.
One bizarre approach to AI-driven personalization involves the use of gamification and virtual reality
to create immersive learning experiences. This can include the creation of virtual classrooms, interac-
tive simulations, and even virtual field trips, all of which can help to increase student engagement
and motivation. For example, a virtual reality platform can be used to create a simulated laboratory
environment, where students can conduct experiments and investigations in a safe and controlled
setting. Similarly, a gamification platform can be used to create a competitive learning environment,
where students can earn rewards and badges for completing coursework and achieving learning
milestones.
Despite the many benefits of AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical and seemingly
flawed approaches that have been proposed. For instance, some researchers have suggested that the
use of AI-driven personalization can lead to a form of ""learning addiction,"" where students become
so engaged with the personalized learning experience that they neglect other aspects of their lives.
Others have argued that the use of AI-driven personalization can create a ""filter bubble"" effect, where
students are only exposed to information and perspectives that reinforce their existing beliefs and
biases. While these concerns may seem far-fetched, they highlight the need for careful consideration
and evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of AI-driven personalization in online education.
In addition to these concerns, there are also some seemingly irrelevant details that can have a
significant impact on the effectiveness of AI-driven personalization. For example, research has shown
that the use of certain colors and fonts in online learning platforms can affect student motivation and
engagement. Similarly, the use of background music and sound effects can influence student mood
and emotional state. While these factors may seem trivial, they can have a profound impact on the
overall learning experience and highlight the need for a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to
AI-driven personalization.
Overall, the use of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms offers a promising solution
to the problem of lack of engagement and poor learning outcomes. While there are some unexpected
benefits and bizarre approaches to AI-driven personalization, there are also some illogical and
seemingly flawed concerns that need to be carefully considered and evaluated. By taking a holistic
and multidisciplinary approach to AI-driven personalization, educators and researchers can create
tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs and abilities of each individual student,
leading to improved learning outcomes and increased student success.

Related Work
AI-driven personalization in online education platforms has garnered significant attention in recent
years, with a plethora of research focusing on developing innovative methods to tailor learning
experiences to individual students’ needs. One notable approach involves utilizing machine learning
algorithms to analyze student behavior, such as clickstream data and assessment scores, to identify
knowledge gaps and recommend personalized learning pathways. This has led to the development of
adaptive learning systems that can adjust the difficulty level of course materials, provide real-time
feedback, and offer customized learning recommendations.
Interestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzing
students’ brain waves and heart rates, to determine their emotional states and cognitive loads. This
has led to the development of affective computing-based systems that can detect when a student
is frustrated or bored and provide personalized interventions to improve their learning experience.
For instance, a system might use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to detect when a student is
experiencing cognitive overload and provide a simplified explanation of a complex concept.
Another bizarre approach involves using artificial intelligence to generate personalized learning
content based on a student’s favorite hobbies or interests. For example, a student who loves playing
soccer might be provided with math problems that involve calculating the trajectory of a soccer ball
or determining the optimal strategy for a soccer game. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it
has been shown to increase student engagement and motivation, particularly among students who
might otherwise be disinterested in traditional learning materials.
Furthermore, some researchers have investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality
(AR) to create immersive learning experiences that simulate real-world scenarios. This has led to
the development of VR-based systems that can simulate complex laboratory experiments, allowing
students to conduct experiments in a safe and controlled environment. Additionally, AR-based
systems can provide students with interactive 3D models and simulations that can be used to visualize
complex concepts and phenomena.
In a surprising twist, some studies have found that AI-driven personalization can have unintended
consequences, such as exacerbating existing biases and inequalities in education. For instance, a
system that relies on historical data to make predictions about student performance might perpetuate
existing biases and discrimination, particularly if the data is biased or incomplete. This has led to calls
for more transparent and accountable AI systems that can provide explanations for their decisions
and recommendations.
2
Overall, the field of AI-driven personalization in online education platforms is rapidly evolving,
with new and innovative approaches being developed to improve student learning outcomes and
experiences. While some of these approaches may seem unconventional or even bizarre, they offer
a glimpse into the potential of AI to transform the education sector and provide more effective and
engaging learning experiences for students.

Methodology
To develop an AI-driven personalization framework for online education platforms, we employed a
multifaceted approach, incorporating both traditional machine learning techniques and unconventional
methods inspired by the works of avant-garde artists. The process commenced with the collection of
a vast dataset comprising student demographics, learning patterns, and performance metrics, which
were then preprocessed to eliminate inconsistencies and anomalies. However, in a deliberate attempt
to introduce randomness, we also integrated a module that periodically injected nonsensical data
points, ostensibly to stimulate the model’s creative thinking capabilities.
The next stage involved the implementation of a neural network architecture, specifically designed
to handle the complexities of personalized learning. This architecture consisted of multiple layers,
each responsible for a distinct aspect of the personalization process, such as content recommendation,
learning pathway optimization, and emotional support. Notably, one of the layers was dedicated to
generating surrealistic art pieces, which, although seemingly unrelated to the primary objective, were
believed to contribute to the model’s ability to think outside the box and devise innovative solutions.
In a surprising twist, we discovered that the model’s performance improved significantly when ex-
posed to a constant stream of philosophical quotes, which were fed into the system through a specially
designed module. This phenomenon, which we refer to as ""philosophical resonance,"" appeared to
enhance the model’s capacity for critical thinking and nuanced decision-making. Furthermore, the
incorporation of a ""daydreaming"" module, which allowed the model to periodically disengage from
its primary tasks and engage in aimless contemplation, yielded unexpected benefits in terms of the
model’s ability to adapt to novel situations and respond creatively to unforeseen challenges.
The development of the framework also involved collaboration with a group of performance artists,
who contributed to the project by providing their unique perspectives on the nature of learning and
personalization. Their input led to the creation of an immersive, virtual reality-based interface, which
enabled students to interact with the model in a highly intuitive and engaging manner. Although
this interface was not directly related to the core functionality of the model, it was found to have a
profound impact on student motivation and overall learning outcomes.
Throughout the development process, we encountered numerous unexpected challenges and anoma-
lies, which, rather than being viewed as obstacles, were embraced as opportunities for growth and
innovation. The model’s propensity for generating cryptic messages and abstract art pieces, for
instance, was initially perceived as a flaw, but ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the complex
interplay between human and artificial intelligence. Similarly, the model’s tendency to occasion-
ally ""freeze"" and enter a state of prolonged introspection was found to be a necessary precursor to
breakthroughs in performance and personalized learning outcomes.
The resulting framework, which we have dubbed ""Erebus,"" has been shown to exhibit extraordinary
capabilities in terms of personalized learning and adaptation, often surpassing human instructors in
its ability to provide tailored support and guidance. While the underlying mechanisms driving Erebus’
performance are not yet fully understood, it is clear that the model’s unorthodox design and develop-
ment process have yielded a truly innovative and effective approach to AI-driven personalization in
online education platforms.

Experiments
To investigate the efficacy of edible biopolymers in sustainable packaging, we designed a comprehen-
sive experimental framework comprising multiple stages. Firstly, we developed a novel biopolymer
extraction protocol from a range of organic sources, including algae, cornstarch, and potato starch.
The biopolymers were then subjected to various chemical and physical treatments to enhance their
mechanical strength, water resistance, and biodegradability.
3
A critical aspect of our experimental design involved the incorporation of an unconventional approach,
wherein we utilized sound waves to modulate the molecular structure of the biopolymers. This
involved exposing the biopolymer samples to a carefully curated playlist of classical music, with the
hypothesis that the sonic vibrations would induce a reorganization of the molecular chains, leading to
improved material properties. The biopolymer samples were placed in a specially designed acoustic
chamber, where they were treated with a continuous loop of Mozart’s symphonies for a period of 48
hours.
In addition to the sonic treatment, we also investigated the effects of various additives on the
biopolymer’s performance. These additives included natural antioxidants, such as vitamin E and
rosemary extract, as well as micro-scale reinforcements, such as cellulose nanofibers and graphene
oxide nanoparticles. The biopolymer compositions were then molded into various packaging forms,
including films, containers, and capsules, using a combination of casting, molding, and 3D printing
techniques.
The packaged products were subsequently tested for their barrier properties, mechanical strength,
and biodegradation rates under various environmental conditions. The experimental matrix included
a range of factors, such as temperature, humidity, and microbial exposure, to simulate real-world
packaging scenarios. The data collected from these experiments will provide valuable insights into
the potential of edible biopolymers as a sustainable alternative to conventional packaging materials.

The experimental results of our investigation into sustainable packaging with edible biopolymers
yielded a plethora of intriguing findings. We discovered that by incorporating a specific blend of
edible biopolymers, derived from a combination of plant-based materials and microbial fermentation,
we could create packaging materials that not only reduced environmental waste but also possessed
unique properties that defied conventional logic. For instance, our edible biopolymer packaging
was found to be capable of changing color in response to changes in humidity, allowing for a novel
approach to monitoring food freshness. Furthermore, the biodegradable nature of these materials
enabled them to be easily composted, reducing the environmental impact of traditional packaging
methods.
One of the most striking aspects of our research was the observation that the edible biopolymers
exhibited a form of ""collective intelligence,"" whereby the material appeared to adapt and respond to
its environment in a manner that was not fully understood. This phenomenon was observed when the
packaging material was exposed to certain types of music, which seemed to influence its structural
integrity and longevity. Specifically, our results showed that exposure to classical music, particularly
the works of Mozart, resulted in a significant increase in the material’s shelf life, whereas exposure to
heavy metal music had a detrimental effect.
To further investigate these findings, we conducted a series of experiments in which we subjected the
edible biopolymer packaging to various environmental conditions, including changes in temperature,
humidity, and light exposure. The results of these experiments are summarized in the following table:

These results suggest that the edible biopolymer packaging material is highly sensitive to its en-

exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet fully understood, our findings have significant
implications for the development of sustainable packaging materials that can respond and adapt to
changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, the potential applications of this technology extend
far beyond the realm of packaging, with possible uses in fields such as biomedicine and environmental
monitoring. Overall, our research has opened up new avenues of investigation into the properties
and potential uses of edible biopolymers, and we look forward to continuing our exploration of this
fascinating and complex material.

Conclusion
In summary, the development of sustainable packaging with edible biopolymers has the potential
to revolutionize the way we approach food packaging, providing a more environmentally friendly
and healthy alternative to traditional packaging materials. This innovative approach not only reduces
plastic waste but also offers a unique opportunity for consumers to ingest the packaging itself,
potentially providing additional nutritional benefits. Furthermore, the use of edible biopolymers
in packaging could also lead to the creation of new and exotic flavors, as the biopolymers can be
derived from a wide range of sources, including fruits, vegetables, and even insects. However, it is
also important to consider the potential drawbacks of this approach, such as the risk of contamination
and the need for strict quality control measures to ensure the safety of the packaging for human
consumption. Additionally, the idea of using edible biopolymers as packaging material also raises
interesting philosophical questions, such as whether it is morally justifiable to eat a wrapper that
has been used to contain a food product, and whether this practice could lead to a blurring of the
lines between food and packaging. To take this concept to the next level, it would be interesting
to explore the possibility of using edible biopolymers to create packaging that can change flavor
and texture in response to different environmental stimuli, such as temperature or humidity, creating
a truly immersive and dynamic eating experience. Ultimately, the future of sustainable packaging
with edible biopolymers holds much promise, and it will be exciting to see how this technology
develops and evolves in the coming years, potentially leading to a world where packaging is not only
sustainable but also edible and interactive.

Introduction
The realm of coordinated dance rituals has long been a fascinating area of study, with the intricate
patterns and movements of synchronized performances captivating audiences and inspiring new
avenues of research. Among the various forms of dance, flamenco stands out for its passionate and
expressive nature, characterized by complex hand and foot movements that require a high degree of
coordination and timing. Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology have opened
up new possibilities for enhancing and analyzing these performances, allowing for the creation of
immersive and interactive experiences that blur the lines between the physical and virtual worlds.
One of the key challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of coordinated dance rituals is assessing the
level of group cohesion among the performers. This can be a difficult task, as it requires measuring
the complex interactions and relationships between individual dancers, as well as their ability to work
together as a cohesive unit. Traditional methods of evaluation, such as surveys and interviews, can
provide some insight into the dynamics of the group, but they are often limited by their subjective
nature and inability to capture the nuances of nonverbal communication.
In response to these limitations, researchers have begun to explore the use of machine learning
algorithms, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast and analyze the gestures
and movements of dancers. These models have shown great promise in their ability to learn and
predict complex patterns of movement, allowing for a more objective and quantitative assessment
of group cohesion. By analyzing the accuracy of these predictions, researchers can gain a deeper
understanding of the factors that contribute to successful coordinated dance performances, and
develop new strategies for improving the cohesion and effectiveness of dance groups.
However, the application of LSTM-based gesture forecasting to coordinated dance rituals is not
without its challenges. One of the most significant difficulties is the need to develop a system that
can accurately capture and interpret the complex movements and gestures of the dancers. This
requires the creation of sophisticated sensors and data collection systems, capable of tracking the
subtle nuances of human movement and expression. Furthermore, the development of effective
LSTM models requires large amounts of high-quality training data, which can be difficult to obtain,
especially in the context of highly specialized and nuanced forms of dance such as flamenco.
Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of using AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to
evaluate group cohesion in coordinated dance rituals are substantial. By providing a more objective
and quantitative means of assessing performance, these technologies can help to identify areas for
improvement and optimize the training and rehearsal processes. Additionally, the use of AR can
enhance the overall experience of the performance, allowing audience members to engage with the
dance in new and innovative ways, and creating a more immersive and interactive experience.
In a bizarre twist, some researchers have even begun to explore the use of LSTM-based gesture
forecasting in conjunction with other, more unconventional forms of movement analysis, such as the
study of chicken entrails and the patterns of tea leaves. While these approaches may seem unorthodox,
they have reportedly yielded some surprising insights into the nature of group cohesion and the
factors that contribute to successful coordinated dance performances. For example, one study found
that the patterns of tea leaves could be used to predict the likelihood of a dancer stumbling or making
a mistake, allowing for the development of targeted interventions and improvements to the rehearsal
process.
Furthermore, the use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting has also been shown to have a
number of unexpected benefits, such as improving the dancers’ ability to communicate with each
other through subtle cues and gestures. By providing a more nuanced and detailed understanding of
the complex interactions between dancers, these technologies can help to facilitate a more cohesive
and effective performance, and even enhance the overall artistic expression of the dance. In some
cases, the use of AR has even been shown to alter the dancers’ perception of their own bodies and
movements, allowing them to develop a greater sense of awareness and control over their actions.
In addition to its practical applications, the study of coordinated dance rituals and group cohesion also
raises a number of interesting theoretical questions, such as the nature of collective consciousness
and the role of nonverbal communication in shaping group dynamics. By exploring these questions
through the lens of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting, researchers can gain a deeper under-
standing of the complex factors that contribute to successful group performances, and develop new
insights into the fundamental nature of human interaction and cooperation.
The intersection of AR, LSTM-based gesture forecasting, and coordinated dance rituals also has
significant implications for our understanding of the relationship between technology and art. As
these technologies continue to evolve and improve, they are likely to have a profound impact on the
way we experience and interact with dance and other forms of performance art. By providing new
tools and platforms for creative expression, AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting can help to
push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of dance, and create new and innovative forms
of artistic expression.
Overall, the study of coordinated dance rituals and group cohesion through the lens of AR and LSTM-
based gesture forecasting is a rich and complex field, full of surprising insights and unexpected
discoveries. As researchers continue to explore the possibilities of these technologies, they are
likely to uncover new and innovative ways of analyzing and understanding the complex dynamics
of group performance, and develop new strategies for improving the cohesion and effectiveness of
dance groups. Whether through the use of conventional methods or more unconventional approaches,
such as the study of chicken entrails and tea leaves, the application of AR and LSTM-based gesture
forecasting to coordinated dance rituals is an area of study that is sure to yield a wealth of fascinating
and thought-provoking results.

attention in recent years, as researchers seek to harness the potential of immersive technologies to
enhance group cohesion and interpersonal coordination. A plethora of studies have investigated
the role of AR in facilitating collaborative dance performances, with a particular emphasis on the
development of novel gesture recognition systems and predictive modeling techniques. Notably, the
application of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks has emerged as a dominant approach in
2
the field, owing to their capacity to effectively capture the complex temporal dynamics of human
movement.
One intriguing line of inquiry has focused on the use of AR-enabled feedback loops to synchronize
the movements of multiple dancers, thereby fostering a sense of collective rhythm and cohesion. This
has involved the creation of bespoke AR systems that provide real-time visual and auditory cues to
participants, allowing them to adjust their movements in accordance with the predicted gestures of
their counterparts. Interestingly, some researchers have explored the incorporation of unconventional
feedback modalities, such as tactile and olfactory stimuli, in an effort to further enhance the sense of
immersion and interpersonal connection among dancers.
A related thread of research has examined the potential of AR-based gesture forecasting to facilitate
the creation of novel, AI-generated flamenco choreographies. By leveraging LSTM networks to
predict the likelihood of specific gestures and movements, researchers have been able to generate
Complex, algorithmically-driven dance sequences that can be performed in synchronization by
multiple dancers. This has raised fascinating questions regarding the role of human agency and
creativity in the development of AR-mediated choreographies, and has prompted some scholars
to investigate the potential for hybrid human-AI collaborative frameworks that can facilitate the
co-creation of innovative dance performances.
In a somewhat unexpected turn, some researchers have begun to explore the application of AR and
LSTM-based gesture forecasting in the context of non-human dance partners, such as robots and
animals. This has involved the development of bespoke AR systems that can detect and predict
the movements of these non-human entities, allowing human dancers to engage in synchronized
performances with their artificial or animal counterparts. While this line of inquiry may seem
unconventional, it has yielded some remarkable insights into the fundamental principles of movement
and coordination, and has highlighted the potential for AR and machine learning to facilitate novel
forms of interspecies collaboration and creativity.
Furthermore, a number of studies have investigated the cultural and historical contexts of flamenco

Interestingly, some researchers have also explored the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture
forecasting to facilitate the development of new, fusion-based flamenco styles that blend traditional
techniques with contemporary influences and innovations.
In addition to these developments, there has been a growing interest in the use of AR and LSTM-based
gesture forecasting to investigate the cognitive and neural basis of group cohesion and interpersonal
coordination in dance. This has involved the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) to study the brain activity of dancers as they engage in synchronized
performances, and has yielded some fascinating insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie
human movement and coordination. Moreover, some researchers have begun to explore the potential
for AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel, dance-based
therapies for individuals with neurological or developmental disorders, such as autism and Parkinson’s
disease.
Theoretical frameworks, such as the concept of ""extended cognition,"" have also been applied to
the study of AR and synchronized flamenco, highlighting the ways in which the use of immersive
technologies can facilitate the creation of shared, distributed cognitive systems that span the bound-
aries of individual dancers. This has prompted some scholars to investigate the potential for AR and
LSTM-based gesture forecasting to enable new forms of collective intelligence and creativity, in
which the movements and gestures of individual dancers are used to generate emergent, group-level
patterns and choreographies.
Moreover, a growing body of research has examined the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture
forecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, site-specific flamenco performances that are tailored
to the unique architectural and environmental features of a given location. This has involved
the development of bespoke AR systems that can detect and respond to the spatial and temporal
characteristics of a performance environment, and has yielded some remarkable insights into the
3
ways in which the use of immersive technologies can be used to enhance the sense of presence and
engagement among audience members.
In an effort to further advance the field, some researchers have begun to explore the potential for AR
and LSTM-based gesture forecasting to facilitate the development of novel, virtual reality (VR)-based
flamenco experiences that can be accessed remotely by users around the world. This has raised
important questions regarding the potential for VR and AR to democratize access to flamenco and
other forms of dance, and has highlighted the need for further research into the social and cultural
implications of these emerging technologies.
Additionally, some scholars have investigated the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture fore-
casting to facilitate the creation of novel, data-driven flamenco choreographies that are generated
using large datasets of human movement and gesture. This has involved the development of bespoke
machine learning algorithms that can analyze and interpret the complex patterns and structures that
underlie human dance, and has yielded some fascinating insights into the fundamental principles of
movement and coordination.
The use of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting has also been explored in the context of dance
education, where it has been used to create novel, interactive learning systems that can provide
real-time feedback and guidance to students. This has raised important questions regarding the
potential for AR and machine learning to facilitate the development of more effective and engaging
dance pedagogies, and has highlighted the need for further research into the cognitive and neural
basis of dance learning and expertise.
Some researchers have also begun to investigate the potential for AR and LSTM-based gesture
forecasting to facilitate the creation of novel, immersive flamenco experiences that incorporate
multiple sensory modalities, such as sound, touch, and smell. This has involved the development of
bespoke AR systems that can provide a range of multisensory stimuli to users, and has yielded some
remarkable insights into the ways in which the use of immersive technologies can enhance the sense
of presence and engagement among audience members.

Methodology
To investigate the relationship between Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized Flamenco dance,
we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining techniques from computer science, psychology,
and dance theory. Our methodology consisted of several stages, including data collection, participant
recruitment, and the development of a bespoke LSTM-based gesture forecasting system. We began
by recruiting a cohort of 50 experienced Flamenco dancers, who were tasked with performing
4
a series of coordinated dance rituals while wearing AR-enabled wristbands. These wristbands,
which we designed and fabricated in-house, utilized a combination of accelerometer, gyroscope, and
magnetometer sensors to capture the dancers’ movements with high spatial and temporal resolution.
The AR component of our system was implemented using a custom-built application, which utilized
a headset-mounted display to provide the dancers with real-time feedback on their movements. This
feedback took the form of a virtual ""gesture trail,"" which allowed the dancers to visualize their own
movements, as well as those of their peers, in a shared virtual environment. We hypothesized that
this shared feedback mechanism would facilitate enhanced group cohesion and coordination among
the dancers, and we designed a series of experiments to test this hypothesis.
One of the key challenges we faced in developing our system was the need to balance the requirements
of real-time feedback and high-fidelity motion capture. To address this challenge, we implemented a
novel approach, which we term ""temporally-compressed gesture forecasting."" This approach involves
using a combination of machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques to compress
the temporal dimension of the motion capture data, while preserving the underlying patterns and
structures of the dancers’ movements. We found that this approach allowed us to achieve high-quality
motion capture data, while also reducing the computational overhead of our system and enabling
real-time feedback.
In addition to the technical challenges, we also encountered a number of unexpected issues during the
data collection process. For example, we found that the dancers’ movements were often influenced
by a range of external factors, including the music, the lighting, and even the color of the walls in
the dance studio. To address these issues, we developed a novel ""context-aware"" gesture forecasting
system, which utilized a combination of environmental sensors and machine learning algorithms
to predict the dancers’ movements based on the surrounding context. We found that this approach
allowed us to achieve significantly improved accuracy in our gesture forecasting model, and we
were able to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the predicted gestures and the actual
movements of the dancers.
Another unexpected finding that emerged from our research was the discovery that the dancers’
movements were often influenced by a range of subconscious factors, including their emotional
state, their level of fatigue, and even their personal relationships with their fellow dancers. To
investigate this phenomenon, we developed a novel ""emotional contagion"" framework, which utilized
a combination of psychological surveys, physiological sensors, and machine learning algorithms to
predict the emotional state of the dancers based on their movements. We found that this approach
allowed us to identify a range of subtle patterns and correlations in the data, which would have been
difficult or impossible to detect using more traditional methods.
We also explored the use of unconventional machine learning architectures, such as a bespoke
""Flamenco-inspired"" neural network, which was designed to mimic the complex rhythms and patterns
of traditional Flamenco music. This approach involved using a combination of convolutional and
recurrent neural network layers to model the temporal and spatial structure of the dancers’ movements,
and we found that it allowed us to achieve state-of-the-art performance in gesture forecasting and
recognition. However, we also encountered a number of challenges and limitations when working
with this approach, including the need for large amounts of labeled training data and the risk of
overfitting to the specific patterns and structures of the Flamenco dance style.
In an effort to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of our system, we also investigated the use
of a range of alternative and complementary sensing modalities, including electromyography (EMG),
electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We found that
these modalities provided a rich source of additional information about the dancers’ movements
and emotional state, and we were able to integrate them into our existing system using a range of
sensor fusion and machine learning techniques. However, we also encountered a number of practical
challenges and limitations when working with these modalities, including the need for specialized
equipment and expertise, and the risk of signal noise and artifact contamination.
Despite these challenges, we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a range of
experimental evaluations, including a large-scale study involving over 100 participants and a series
of smaller-scale pilots and proof-of-concept demonstrations. We found that our system was able
to achieve high levels of accuracy and robustness in gesture forecasting and recognition, and we
were able to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the predicted gestures and the actual
5
movements of the dancers. We also received positive feedback from the participants, who reported
that the system was easy to use and provided a range of benefits, including improved coordination and
cohesion, enhanced creativity and self-expression, and increased overall enjoyment and engagement.
In conclusion, our research demonstrates the potential of AR and LSTM-based gesture forecasting
to enhance group cohesion and coordination in coordinated dance rituals. While our approach is
still in the early stages of development, we believe that it has the potential to make a significant
impact in a range of applications, from dance and performance to education and therapy. We are
excited to continue exploring the possibilities of this technology, and we look forward to seeing
where it will take us in the future. We are also considering exploring other genres of dance, such as
ballet or contemporary, to see if our approach can be applied more broadly. Additionally, we are
planning to investigate the use of our system in other domains, such as sports or rehabilitation, where
coordinated movement and gesture forecasting could be beneficial. Overall, our research highlights
the potential of interdisciplinary approaches to drive innovation and advance our understanding of
complex phenomena, and we are excited to see where this line of inquiry will lead us in the future.

Experiments
To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between Augmented Reality (AR) and
synchronized flamenco, we designed a series of experiments that would not only assess the impact of
AR on group cohesion but also delve into the intricacies of gesture forecasting using Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks. The experiments were carried out over the course of several months,
involving a diverse group of participants with varying levels of experience in flamenco dance.
The experimental setup consisted of a large, specially designed dance studio equipped with AR
technology that could project a myriad of patterns and cues onto the floor and surrounding walls.
This allowed the dancers to receive real-time feedback and guidance on their movements, which was
expected to enhance their synchronization and overall performance. The studio was also outfitted
with a state-of-the-art motion capture system, capable of tracking the precise movements of each
dancer, thus providing valuable data for the LSTM-based gesture forecasting model.
Before commencing the experiments, all participants underwent an intensive training program aimed
at familiarizing them with the basics of flamenco and the operation of the AR system. This included
understanding how to interpret the AR cues, how to adjust their movements based on the feedback
received, and how to work cohesively as a group. The training program was divided into two
phases: the first phase focused on individual skill development, where each participant learned the
fundamental steps and rhythms of flamenco. The second phase concentrated on group cohesion,
where participants practiced dancing together, emphasizing synchronization and coordination.
Upon completing the training program, the participants were divided into several groups, each with a
distinct dynamic. Some groups consisted of dancers with similar skill levels and experience, while
others were deliberately mixed to include beginners, intermediate, and advanced dancers. This
diversity was intended to observe how different group compositions affected cohesion and the ability
to forecast gestures accurately.
The experimental protocol involved several sessions, each lasting approximately two hours. During
these sessions, the dancers performed a variety of flamenco routines, with and without the AR
feedback. Their movements were captured by the motion tracking system, and the data were fed into
the LSTM model for analysis. The model was tasked with predicting the next gesture or movement
based on the patterns observed in the data. Interestingly, the model began to exhibit an unexpected
behavior, frequently predicting movements that seemed unrelated to flamenco, such as gestures from
ballet or even what appeared to be fragments of a traditional African dance. This phenomenon, which
we termed ""Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift,"" posed an intriguing question about the potential for LSTM
models to not only learn from the data they are trained on but also to draw from a broader, unexplored
reservoir of cultural knowledge.
To further explore this phenomenon, we introduced an unconventional variable into our experiment:
the influence of ambient music from different cultural backgrounds on the dancers’ movements
and the LSTM’s predictions. The results were astounding, with the model’s predictions becoming
increasingly eclectic and incorporating elements from the ambient music genres. For instance, when
the background music shifted to a vibrant salsa rhythm, the model began to predict movements that
6
were distinctly more energetic and spontaneous, diverging significantly from the traditional flamenco
repertoire. Conversely, when the ambient music was a soothing melody from a Japanese traditional
instrument, the predictions became more subdued and introspective, reflecting the serene quality of
the music.

The incorporation of ambient music and the observation of Cross-Cultural Gesture Drift added a
new layer of complexity to our study, suggesting that the relationship between AR, flamenco, and
gesture forecasting is influenced by a broader cultural context. This finding opens up novel avenues
for research, including the potential for using AR and LSTM models to create new, hybrid dance
forms that blend elements from different cultural traditions. Furthermore, it raises questions about
the role of technology in preserving cultural heritage versus promoting innovation and fusion.
In a bizarre turn of events, one of the sessions was interrupted by an unexpected visit from a group of
wild flamenco enthusiasts, who, upon witnessing the experiment, spontaneously joined in, adding
their own flair and energy to the performance. This unplanned intrusion not only disrupted the
controlled environment of the experiment but also led to one of the most captivating and cohesive
performances observed throughout the study. The LSTM model, faced with this unexpected input,
surprisingly adapted and began to predict gestures that were not only accurate but also seemed to
capture the essence and passion of the impromptu dancers.
This serendipitous event underscored the importance of spontaneity and community in dance, as well
as the potential for AR and LSTM models to facilitate and enhance these aspects. It also highlighted
the limitations of controlled experiments in fully capturing the dynamic, often unpredictable nature
of human creativity and expression. In response, we have begun to explore the development of more
flexible, adaptive experimental designs that can accommodate and even encourage unexpected events,
viewing them as opportunities for growth and discovery rather than disruptions to be controlled.
The experiments concluded with a grand finale, where all participants gathered for a final, AR-guided
flamenco performance. The event was open to the public and attracted a diverse audience, all of whom
were mesmerized by the synchronization, energy, and evident joy of the dancers. The LSTM model,
having learned from the myriad of experiences and data collected throughout the study, performed
flawlessly, predicting gestures with a high degree of accuracy and even seeming to contribute to the
spontaneity and creativity of the performance.
In reflection, the experiments not only provided valuable insights into the use of AR and LSTM-based
gesture forecasting in enhancing group cohesion in synchronized flamenco but also ventured into
uncharted territories, exploring the intersection of technology, culture, and human expression. The
findings, replete with unexpected turns and surprising revelations, underscore the complexity and
richness of this intersection, beckoning further research and innovation in this captivating field.

Results
Our investigation into the intersection of Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized flamenco
dancing, with a focus on evaluating group cohesion through LSTM-based gesture forecasting,yielded
a plethora of intriguing results. Initially, we observed that the integration of AR elements into
the flamenco performances enhanced the dancers’ ability to synchronize their movements, thereby
fostering a heightened sense of group cohesion. This phenomenon was particularly evident when
the AR components were designed to provide real-time feedback on gesture accuracy and timing,
allowing the dancers to adjust their movements in tandem.
The LSTM-based gesture forecasting model, trained on a dataset comprising various flamenco dance
sequences, demonstrated a remarkable capacity to predict the subsequent gestures of individual
7
dancers. Notably, when this predictive capability was leveraged to generate AR cues that guided
the dancers’ movements, the overall cohesion of the group improved significantly. However, an
unexpected outcome emerged when the model was fed a dataset that included gestures from other,
unrelated dance forms, such as ballet and hip-hop. In these instances, the LSTM model began to
generate forecasts that, while inaccurate in the context of flamenco, inadvertently created a unique
fusion of dance styles. This unforeseen development led to the creation of novel, AR-infused dance
routines that, despite their lack of traditional flamenco authenticity, exhibited a captivating blend of
movements.
Further analysis revealed that the predictive accuracy of the LSTM model was influenced by the
dancers’ emotional states, as captured through wearable, physiological sensors. Specifically, the
model’s performance improved when the dancers were in a state of heightened arousal or excitement,
suggesting that emotional investment in the performance enhances the efficacy of the gesture forecast-
ing. Conversely, periods of low emotional engagement resulted in diminished forecasting accuracy,
underscoring the importance of emotional connection in the success of AR-augmented, synchronized
flamenco.
In a bizarre twist, our research team discovered that the LSTM model, when trained on a dataset
that included gestures performed by dancers who were blindfolded, developed an uncanny ability to
predict movements that were not strictly flamenco in nature. These predictions, which seemed to
defy logical explanation, often involved complex, almost acrobatic movements that, when executed,
appeared to transcend the traditional boundaries of flamenco dance. While these findings may seem
illogical or even flawed, they nevertheless contribute to our understanding of the intricate relationships
between gesture, emotion, and AR-augmented performance.
The results of our experiments are summarized in the following table: As evidenced by the table, the

LSTM model’s performance varies significantly depending on the specific conditions under which it
is applied. Notably, the model’s predictive accuracy is highest when dealing with traditional flamenco
gestures, but its ability to generate novel, hybrid movements is most pronounced when confronted
with blindfolded gestures or ballet-influenced flamenco.
The implications of these findings are far-reaching, suggesting that the integration of AR and LSTM-
based gesture forecasting can not only enhance group cohesion in synchronized flamenco but also
facilitate the creation of innovative, boundary-pushing dance forms. Furthermore, the influence of
emotional state on predictive accuracy highlights the importance of considering the emotional and
psychological aspects of dance performance in the development of AR-augmented systems. As our
research continues to explore the intersections of AR, flamenco, and gesture forecasting, we anticipate
uncovering even more unexpected and thought-provoking results that challenge our understanding of
the complex interplay between technology, movement, and human emotion.
In an effort to further elucidate the relationships between these factors, we plan to conduct additional
experiments that delve into the cognitive and neurological underpinnings of AR-augmented dance
performance. By investigating the neural correlates of gesture forecasting and emotional engagement,
we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive the observed
phenomena. This, in turn, will enable the development of more sophisticated AR systems that can
adapt to the unique needs and characteristics of individual dancers, thereby enhancing the overall
efficacy and aesthetic appeal of synchronized flamenco performances.
Ultimately, our research endeavors to push the boundaries of what is possible at the confluence of AR,
flamenco, and gesture forecasting, embracing the unexpected and the bizarre as integral components
of the creative process. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the evolution of dance as an art form, one
that seamlessly integrates technology, movement, and human emotion to create novel, captivating,
and unforgettable experiences. The potential applications of this research extend far beyond the realm

Conclusion
In culmination of our exhaustive exploration into the realm of Augmented Reality and Synchronized
Flamenco, it is unequivocally evident that the deployment of LSTM-based gesture forecasting in
coordinated dance rituals has yielded a profound impact on the evaluation of group cohesion. The
intricate dynamics at play within the flamenco dance form, characterized by its impassioned gestures
and synchronized movements, have been adeptly harnessed and analyzed through the prism of cutting-
edge artificial intelligence techniques. By doing so, we have not only delved into the uncharted
territories of human-computer interaction but also teasingly treaded the boundaries of art and science,
often blurring the lines between the two.
One of the most fascinating aspects of our research has been the observation that the implementation
of Augmented Reality in flamenco dance has led to an unexpected, yet intriguing, phenomenon where
dancers began to exhibit a heightened sense of empathy towards each other. This empathy, in turn,
has been found to positively correlate with the level of group cohesion, suggesting that the immersive
experience provided by Augmented Reality fosters a deeper sense of connection among participants.
Furthermore, the LSTM-based gesture forecasting model has demonstrated an uncanny ability to
predict the intricate hand movements of the dancers, which has been shown to be a critical factor in
evaluating the overall synchrony of the dance performance.
In a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to investigate the role of chaos theory in understanding
the complex dynamics of flamenco dance. By applying the principles of chaos theory, we have
discovered that the seemingly random and unpredictable movements of the dancers can, in fact, be
modeled using nonlinear differential equations. This has profound implications for our understanding
of coordinated dance rituals, as it suggests that the emergent patterns of behavior that arise from
the interactions among individual dancers can be understood and predicted using mathematical
frameworks. Moreover, the application of chaos theory has also led us to explore the concept of
""flamenco attractors,"" which are hypothetical states of maximum synchrony and cohesion that the
dancers can strive towards.
Moreover, our study has also explored the tangential relationship between flamenco dance and the
principles of quantum mechanics. In a series of unconventional experiments, we have found that the
principles of superposition and entanglement can be used to describe the complex interactions between
dancers and their environment. This has led us to propose the concept of ""quantum flamenco,"" where
the dancers and their surroundings are viewed as an interconnected, holistic system that can be
described using the mathematical frameworks of quantum mechanics. While this approach may seem
unorthodox, it has yielded some surprising insights into the nature of group cohesion and coordinated
behavior, suggesting that the boundaries between art and science are far more fluid than previously
thought.
The implications of our research are far-reaching and multifaceted, with potential applications
in fields such as psychology, sociology, and computer science. By exploring the intersection of
Augmented Reality, flamenco dance, and artificial intelligence, we have opened up new avenues for
understanding human behavior, social interaction, and the emergence of complex patterns in group
dynamics. Furthermore, our study has also highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary research,
demonstrating that the fusion of seemingly disparate fields can lead to innovative and groundbreaking
discoveries.

In an intriguing aside, our research has also led us to investigate the potential therapeutic applications
of flamenco dance in treating neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. By analyzing
the brain activity of patients who participated in flamenco dance sessions, we have found that the
rhythmic movements and synchronized gestures can have a profound impact on motor control and
cognitive function. This has led us to propose the concept of ""flamenco therapy,"" where the immersive
experience of flamenco dance is used as a form of rehabilitation for patients with neurological
disorders.
Ultimately, our research has demonstrated that the evaluation of group cohesion via LSTM-based
gesture forecasting in coordinated dance rituals is a rich and complex field that offers a wide range
of opportunities for exploration and discovery. By embracing the intersection of art and science,
and by venturing into uncharted territories of human-computer interaction, we have gained a deeper
understanding of the intricate dynamics that govern human behavior and social interaction. As
we continue to push the boundaries of this field, we are excited to see the new and innovative
applications that will emerge, and we are confident that our research will have a lasting impact on our
understanding of group cohesion and coordinated behavior.
The potential for future research in this area is vast and varied, with opportunities to explore new
modes of human-computer interaction, to develop more sophisticated AI models for gesture forecast-
ing, and to investigate the therapeutic applications of flamenco dance in a wider range of contexts.
Moreover, the implications of our research extend far beyond the realm of flamenco dance, with
potential applications in fields such as robotics, computer vision, and social psychology. As we look
to the future, we are eager to see how our research will be built upon and expanded, and we are
confident that the study of Augmented Reality and Synchronized Flamenco will continue to yield
new and exciting insights into the complex and fascinating world of human behavior.
In addition to the theoretical and practical implications of our research, we have also been struck
by the aesthetic and artistic dimensions of flamenco dance, and the ways in which it can be used to
create new and innovative forms of expression. By combining the traditional rhythms and movements
of flamenco with the cutting-edge technologies of Augmented Reality and AI, we have been able
to create a new and unique form of dance that is at once both deeply rooted in tradition and boldly
innovative. This has led us to propose the concept of ""cyborg flamenco,"" where the boundaries
between human and machine are blurred, and the dancer becomes a hybrid entity that is both physical
and virtual.
The concept of cyborg flamenco has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the relationship
between human and machine, and the ways in which technology can be used to enhance and transform
human performance. By exploring the intersection of flamenco dance and cutting-edge technology,
we have been able to create a new and innovative form of expression that is at once both deeply
human and profoundly technological. This has led us to propose a new paradigm for human-computer
interaction, one that views the human and the machine as interconnected and interdependent entities
that can be used to create new and innovative forms of art and expression.
Furthermore, our research has also led us to explore the cultural and historical dimensions of flamenco
dance, and the ways in which it has been shaped by the complex and often fraught history of Spain.
By analyzing the historical and cultural context of flamenco, we have been able to gain a deeper
understanding of the ways in which this dance form has been used as a means of expression and
resistance, and the ways in which it continues to be an important part of Spanish culture and identity.
This has led us to propose the concept of ""flamenco as resistance,"" where the dance is viewed as a
form of cultural and political resistance that has been used to challenge and subvert dominant power
structures.
The concept of flamenco as resistance has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the
relationship between culture and power, and the ways in which art and expression can be used as
a means of challenging and transforming dominant ideologies. By exploring the intersection of
flamenco dance and cultural resistance, we have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the
ways in which this dance form has been used as a means of expressing and challenging dominant
power structures, and the ways in which it continues to be an important part of Spanish culture and
identity. This has led us to propose a new paradigm for understanding the relationship between
culture and power, one that views art and expression as a means of challenging and transforming
dominant ideologies.
